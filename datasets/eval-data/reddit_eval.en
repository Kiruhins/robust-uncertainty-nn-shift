The only Anycubic resin I've ever used is the bottle of translucent green that came with my original Photon.
I wasn't impressed with its durability at all, similar to the what the other commenters said.
It's just too fragile for things like chess pieces and D&D miniatures.
About the Bugs, we saw them in the background of season 5 for sure AND we got a Jocasta flashback about the gold.

It's just one more person's opinion, but I recently rewatched the first LotR and I was a bit shocked at how obviously CGI Gollum looked.

\*One example of how oppression-free HK is the fact that some schools have Long Hair (Leung Kwok Hung)'s textbooks as part of their Liberal Studies.

Think of it as macros/python with a GUI to do a lot the work instead of writing code.
I'm on the consulting side of Corp Fin & have used it on clients that get consistently messy data from a system to clean the data into a more usable form.
It's very intuitive & works really well, IMO.
If I knew about Alteryx before picking up Python, I probably wouldn't even need Python on my job, tbh.
The only nice part about Python, at this point, is Python is free and can do a little more than Alteryx, since it's a lower-level way of talking to systems.
Since not all clients/companies want to pay for another program, knowing Python is useful for automating tasks when I can't use Alteryx to do it for me.

On Muramasa, not really.
Narita talks about how he likes referencing filler & those can be taken with a grain of salt.
That said, all he says about Muramasa, as far as I can recall, is that it's a hereditary Zanpakuto, so it wouldn't really contradict the plot at all just if there was a Zanpakuto called Muramasa.
We could also reasonably infer that it has the same basic power.
I wouldn't say it means the whole Zanpakuto Rebellion happened, though.
Even if there was some kind of Zanpakuto Rebellion, it could be something that happened in the Soul Society's distant past, rather than the actual events depicted in the filler arc.
I was in the same exact position a couple of months ago.

If you're spending 5-10 mil in a day over a 3 hour session and chadding labs, you don't represent the average player base even in the slightest.
So he traumatised Kaneki even more in order to force him to create a new identity, which he then helped Kaneki in constructing.

Thankfully I figured it out, but I love to walk/jog around now and not use fast travel.
So I would say to just do what you want, go where you want, save often, do your first playthrough unmodded (vanilla) and you are allowed to not go by the lore and join the stormcloaks if you want.
You will definitely make more characters in the future.
Also, you don't have to do everything at once, you can do some bounty jobs for the holds and level up you character before deciding what to do.
Have fun!

What type of exercise, are you calculating the exercise into your calorie allotment, what type of calories are you eating?
All of these can affect what’s happening.
If you aren’t calculating the calories from your exercise, you may be eating too little or too much and either of those can prevent weight loss.
Also calculating those calories accurately via a tracking app helps, a lot of people often estimate the amount of calories they are eating and usually you are eating more than you think.
I use the (free) Lose It app to calculate my calories and I have a Garmin Forerunner to track my steps and calories from my workouts.
If you are already doing all of these things, your body may just be acclimating to your new routine.
Usually it takes me two weeks to really start seeing movement on the scale with CICO ( 29F 5’7” 150lbs)

But blocking payments to crypto has no effect on AML.

Made this + curd with regular lemons last weekend.
It turned out amazing!
I doubled the curd recipe and I’m so happy to have a jar of it in my fridge.
I used an equal weight of slivered almonds, and messed up the water amount but the crust still turned out beautifully.
Highly recommend.
Meh, this is harsh but fair.
Maybe just don't write a little blurb for every one?

You should've thought about how things would be between you and your friend had things not worked out.
You told her that you'll need time given the context.
So I think you should be the one to reach out.
Even then, frENDS.
Go out and make new friends.
Go out and give your dating life more options.
I wanna eat it from the back 🤤
>Julia Whelan or Bahni Turpin.
The problem with Turpin is that she so often narrates shit books that it's too easy to associate her with lack of quality.
Which is a shame because for my money both of these voice actresses are the same tier as Porter and Bray.

ok so 50% of your reasoning is because "ppl" want plex prices to increase.
another 25% wants to be able to have 85 minutes of omega time/plex.
the final 25% just thinks he'll win a bet about plex prices increasing.
so then which are you?
a. the guy who wants plex to increase or b. the guy that bet on plex will skyrocket?

As long as there's no monolith to defend like 11-2, I'm fine with this idea.
Troofer got on an anti-semitism kick awhile ago and it shows no sign of stopping.
It's a shame too, I used to defend his wikiposting but now it's gotten very samey.
I have cast out my satanistic and rational mindset and have now found the truth in whatever some guy that lives in a church says!
He would know whats best for me because he read a book a couple times and can awkwardly sing when he needs to.
Personally I would love more people to stand up for everyone when some are essentially endangering others, maybe then there would be less arseholes, evil prevails when good men stand by and do nothing

No, the bullet points are considered a good format for your skills because they are easy to read and allow your most important keywords to stand out.

You could try lowering the mining intensity.
You will get lower hashrates, but your gui should be more usable.
I believe the command line is -mi.
You can set it 0-22 I believe.
Something like 15 might make the gui more usable.
DanTDM, PopularMMOs, Ssundee, stampylongnose, and other Minecraft youtuber I was obsessed with.
Nowadays their channel either died or they moved on to other games.

But that's just never how it will be.
You'd probably get a better opinion by mining through 4chan shit.
All of it just a waste of time (or to waste time).

Some dogs are just assholes.
We had three (mostly) labs from the same litter.
Raised them together, and the same.
Two were big old bumbly loveable labs like one would expect - they loved everyone and everything.
The third one was just an asshole.
He was good with the family, but not anyone else.
He was also kind of an asshole to the other dogs and cats in the family, including but not limited to his littermates.

Idk man, fuck antimaskers but I got jumped once and got my nose broken and it’s an absolutely brutal injury to deal with.

I don't like you.
I don't like anybody who has as little respect for others as you do.
Go away, you swine.
You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit.
You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt.
You are a jerk, a cad, and a weasel.
Your life is a monument to stupidity.
You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.
You are a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world.
Meaningful to no one, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts that sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.
I have a boyfriend and I have limerence for another guy, not at that point of stalking so much but I have it and I suffer so much.
I honestly don't think Barry can jump into the Speed Force in the Knightmare future.
He's simply not able because he hasn't practiced doing it yet.
Otherwise he wouldn't need the treadmill tbh.
I think the best he can do is reverse time instead of actually jumping into the time stream and fixing the future.
That's why they go the treadmill route.
Barry runs in the same spot until time is reversed back to when he warns Bruce with a boom tube opened ready to suck him back to the exact time he came from which is why he didn't just end up back in the past

I was basically told that anything goes with stims and ER.
During stims so far (day 8 here), I've had a bladder infection that came with a fever that I've treated with Cipro, a covid vaccine, and other random health issues.
They told me none of that matters.

For those who can go and/or do go straight to industry, I agree with you.
But again, it's a question of age.
When I was making my decision, I was 48 years old, and had spent many years working in pink-collar wage (read barely above minimum) jobs before I even got a bachelor's at 39.
When I was deciding what to do next, these were things I needed to take into consideration.
I had a lot of lost retirement savings time to make up, and I couldn't afford/can't afford to take 4 years off even with a graduate student stipend.
A 2 or 3 year program suited my financial position.
But I'd mentioned that--had I been 25 years younger, the calculations would have been radically different.

YouTube built in "YouTube Shorts" which are basically TikTok, now they make the dislike button useless.
They also ban/demonetize everything containing political content, especially stuff related to war etc.
I feel like YouTube is slowly turning into TikTok.

Keep driving the price down hedge fucks, I’ll just keep buying more 🍌🍌🍌

i just did the same last night.
But my gems are free earned from the game, i guess i just returned it to plarium 🤣
Depends on the upvotes it has and if I'm in public where someone might be looking at my screen.
If it has over 1k upvotes and I'm in public, one little upvote won't affect a lot probably.
Yes, do it.
And then say: "What an awesome community!
Sexist shit is downvoted to hell."
You should be able to just keep it up.
One of her talents decreases her cooldown on her E by 0.3 seconds for every normal or charged crit attack, so ideally you would E, then normal attack 2 or 3 times, then E again.
You could repeat that until you have full stacks of the 4 piece, then use your hold E or your Q. Additionally, if you have her 2nd constellation, her hold E is also 4 seconds, so you can just constantly cycle two press E’s and one hold E (for the Grimheart stacks), while maintaining the 4 piece buff.

Breuh Sherman is old and washed coming off a huge injury lol get real
My order from McMunn and Yates was like.. 60% crap that I had to return myself, after it was delivered.
No exaggeration.
I can't fucking take it.
I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it.
"Oh that looks kinda like the sarvante mod" it started as.
That's funny, that's a cool reference.
But I kept going, I'd see a ice cream that looked like sarvante, I'd see an animated black and white rainbow that looked like Sarvante, I'd see a shirt that looked like Sarvante.
And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words THAT'S VEY UNHOLY OF YOU ran through my head.
It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an napolitan ice cream.
I can't fucking live like this...
I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't!
And don't get me fucking started on the words!
I'll never hear the word servant again without thinking of Mid Fight masses.
Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than "Ruv."
I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is "reminds me of ruv" and laugh like a fucking insane person.
And the word "nun" is ruined.
The phrase "napolitan" is ruined.
I can't live anymore.
Mid Fight Masses has destroyed my fucking life.
I want to exorcise myself from this plane of existence.
MAKE IT STOP!

As an Armed Guard in the US, I carried a HK45.
I also owned an AR-15 rifle.
The rifle was unwieldy in confined spaces, and depending on the circumstances less lethal than the handgun.
There's a reason that the US has 364 rifle deaths in 2019, but had 600 deaths from physical combat and 1,476 knife deaths.
Weapons that look like weapons of war (assault-style weapons) are not a significant threat, in the US, or in Canada.
I mean, you can call said person whatever you want, doesn't make it any less pathetic your only response to a supposed child molester is "[pronoun specifically chosen to trigger the libs] is ugly" lmao.

There's no such crossplay between platforms ie.
So game pass owners can play the game online but with only with within the same platform.
However you can install the xbox version on PC through the game pass and as such this may be where the confusion comes from.
I have downloaded the xbox version on my laptop and I currently play with my friends on xbox.
Hope this helps 🙂

Comparatively, the most deadly is Felix Lamarx who is categorized with Melody and Juniper, except he has no qualms of fighting and will not hesitate to blast his way out of a problem if given the chance, although he does understand the power of diplomacy.
He’s also the head of a cult worshipping powerful mages such as Juniper like gods.
In a one-on-one he will destroy, but take 2-3 characters that can at least match Keiko for awhile in skill, and he will breakdown.

My take would be TOK-ish, wherein choosing a non-sticker attack would allow you to do only 1 per turn, causing the need to use stickers.
Like how CS implemented semi-EXP via hammer scraps, enemies would drop book pages, which would increase the stickers Mario can take with him in his inventory if enough are collected.

Hey it’s your cake day.
A huge change to your build and boom efficiency would be to send 2 vills to stone as you click to feudal and gather 10 gold.
That way you sell 100 stone instead of 100 wood and don't have a vill walking back and forth 3 times.
Also makes it so you can drop your 4th and 5th TCs far earlier.
Id normally have my 4th down by 18 min and 5th around 20

In regards to genetic communities I have a hunch that groups of people who migrated to Western Canada might be one of the upcoming updates to this portion of AncestryDNA.
I see this mainly because there are already quite a few Western Canadians who have taken AncestryDNA, and it is one of the few regions in North America that doesn't have really that much coverage in respect to genetic communities (Pretty much just Southern Albertan Mormons and Canadian Icelanders currently).
Some of things I would like to see come out of that would include: Métis settler groups, Ukrainian and/or Russian communities, French and/or Belgian communities (I have lots of ancestry from Lorraine & Haute Marne, so I'd be interested to see this), refined Germans from Russia communities (I'm part Crimean German, so something just for that part of my background would be nice), and refined British communities (If Ancestry is capable of identifying 94 genetic communities in Ireland, Scotland and England can easily get more detailed communities).

I know there is no confirmation of it or anything but from someone who has played this game all too much, I feel like skill based or at least ridiculous matchmaking is in this game now.
This ruins the feel of every game for me and I’m tired of the way companies keep doing this to pander to the lowest common denominator (obviously for money ik they ain’t dumb) and inadvertently hoe everyone else out who is a long-standing member of the community.
I used to play cod religiously and the past few ones, while still being enjoyable, I didn’t like having to do well in 1 game and proceed to have Cod champs for my next 5 lobbies cause the game decided I was doing too well.
And here we are again, on 2k.
I feel like I’m not playing the best either this season but there is no shot I got from a 58-10 season with 2 Ls being lag outs, to 8-7 this season and even sweatier games in tto than usual.
I got on 2 days ago after class and fucking played Dichotomy (comp player from last year) and Isaac back to back games.
This shit is mentally draining.
I don’t wanna roll over people every game but with a structure of having to play 50+ games a season for anything worth while of a reward and having 75% of them be comp games is ridiculous.
I feel like I’ve been bitching a lot lately about this game here and don’t want to come off negative, but I just love 2k and the way they, or other game companies operate, is just a depressing fuck you to us as players more often than not.
I got other shit going on aside from this game between finishing up college, social life and all that but I like to come back to gaming to either have a good time with friends and enjoy myself.
Skills based ruins everything in that regard and this is the least fun I’ve had in a season on this game, and I even quit for the entire Dwayne Wade reward season to take a break.
I am probably not smarter but I am studying biology in University.
A plant has only 3 organs: leaf, root and stem.
Everything you find on a plant is a modified  organ.
Petals and the inner parts of the flowers are modified leafs.
So the plant probably messed something up and produced this halfleaf.
Argh, I'm so gutted right now.
The game is far buggier and performs worse since I installed this new patch.
Watching this clip and reading the comments on this sub are heartbreaking for me right now because it seems nobody else is really having issues and is excited about how much this has improved things whereas it has had the polar opposite effect for me.
So many broken and glitchy animations, popping NPCs and the biggest culprit is lip synching being all over the place.
Characters' lips don't move more often than they do while talking to me.
I guess this is karma for me having hardly any issues with the game in its last few versions.
There have been some good porn to come out of deepfakes.

Another comment I have is the lack of ambient sfx of her spells, especially her W. There should be more Disco-y beats/music playing.
Her ability sound very sugar rushy-arcade.. just needs a more prominent beat playing in the background in my opinion!
KOTM and GvK may swap places in the future.

at the end of the day, this argument will never be resolved so the best advise is to curate your own fandom experience.
writing and sharing work should be fun!
some fandoms are more toxic than others.
take breaks when you need, use comment moderation, and don’t be afraid to quit fandom if the people in it are not your type of people.

Wild guess: Bethesda User ID?

Racism exists.
A component of racism is cultural suprememacy: the idea that the culture of racial and ethnic minorities is inferior to that of white people.
Rap (more accurately called hip-hop–rap is a technique, not a genre) is part of black culture, so it is likewise seen as inferior.
Mmmh I see someone is dripping already 😍😛
Pattern is "P-40 Warhawk" from the Stoney Creek Legendary Aircraft booklet.
For the testint i've done looks like a crapie pc can produce the same as a high end pc.
just to note, some people might call me a idiot for saying that the over use of a DLL or .C file can lead to bugs/crashes, this isint a problem with newer games but for a game in 2012 this is a issue for ZombiU

I know they do here in Texas.

I don't tend to get one myself, but that's also b/c my army is heavily mechanized so my KFF options are a lot more expensive than if I were mostly footslogging.

If you were to actually put this in the console would it take you to the app where you can play music or would it be for say, a game that also has the music involved in it and there is 21 levels to match the 21 tracks?
or would it be a musical movie kinda like Melanie Martinez's k-12 film?

3rd edition is basically a cleaner playing version of 2nd and it's been out for over a year now.
There is no longer a 1" bounceback if you fail to route a unit which speeds the game up a bit and prevents some of the wonkeyness that would happen  becuase of that.
There weren't any huge changes to the various armies though The Brotherhood got split into 2 sub factions with one allied to Basilea and the other to the Forces of Nature.

Don’t spend your time on the internet arguing over opinions and personal beliefs.
A lot of things you said were very hypocritical and instead of arguing we can unite and make this world a better place and not by arguing back and forth.
But besides that did you say “get fucked”??
Lmao I recommend you never say that corny shit again for your own sake.
I’ll leave it at that.
Play devils advocate.
Dont tunnel vision on only your beliefs because there are so many others out there.
Nice I still feel the same for Neith.
Even if she does look like she's made of plastic and still has big floppy titties 🤔
Literally the comments on this post are so edgy and weird.
the song is very upfront about what she had to deal with so why would the music video not be similar ??
Tastes like chicken.
And I doubly agree on the ethical intrigue.
Both aspects prove to me that the writing is still there.
It's simply the execution that hasn't been up to par, at least yet.
Maybe the budget was reserved for the latter half.
That Koku v Kirisame fight should slap!
It’s an Asian thing man🤣🤣
Yep, not showering for a week, will be doing drugs and cranking out tik toks in that make up for days.
New player as well but this is what I've found in the 35ish hours I've put in so far.
I've tried putting my pilots to explore... they're all idiots.
Even my 4 star pilots will fly directly into an asteroid, or in circles.
I've even had a couple pilots pathfind to the target I gave them by flying a circle around the galaxy.... when they were already in the system the target was in lol.
Your honor, I present evidence #42069 into the official record on why cats are assholes.
Definitely can't be a circlejerk from within the political party they're affiliated with.
Did you read the DD it all connects.
He wasn’t making wild conspiracy theories he was just connecting the facts with graphs and actual charts to represent the numbers.
In my opinion I like the DD and I like the stock.
I won’t give financial advice and I wouldn’t even take my own financial advice but if the market was crashing Great Depression style your best bet “hypothetically” would be to buy precious metals such as silver and gold.
Coins or whatever .999 Troy ounce silver and gold, food, water ect.
But possibly reinvest some tendies in oil and health stocks long term or things people would need.
It's a weeb looking champion.

Nomadland, another round and Judas and the black messiah are some of the best that I have seen this year.
I will check the others too!
I would prefer for Reeves to take the Nolan approach.
Though Batfleck is my favourite yet, I also want a Batman that exists in our world.

Nate is hoping masvidal beats Usman and if he beats Leon, he gets a title shot.
I'm in Bortle 3-4 and the conditions were ideal, but yes thats what I think every time I take a picture of this target.
I take like 3 and select the best one and pretty much done.
It'll be back in a few months I'm going to try to stack and crop it to see how big I can get it!
Really appreciate the feedback!

There's a lot more to a good job than money.
They ask that because they want someone who'll be into their work and fit in with the place well.
If you go in there saying "uhhh idk money duhh" you sound like a teenager with a negative attitude who doesn't give a shit about the job and will only do the bare minimum to not get fired.
They're sorting out the kind of people who are there for the paycheck and the kind of people who are there because they love their work and take pride in it.
I haven’t thought of it like that, tbh this will be my first ever portfolio
He is a good person then.
Other female subreddit or social medias could be like tik tok or something are more female dominated so they more likely discuss their issues etc.
Would you mine explaining further the transferring gold from rs3 to osrs?
I thought that was a big no, and I'm not even sure how you would do it.
Why can’t he just be imperfect, and interesting, like other people?
I just hope he produces more thought-provoking conversations about music, money, media, science, etc.
Such a shambles.
I know HCWs who couldn’t even book in for an appt with a GP to get vaccinated.
The hospital they work at privately has had to step in and assign them  vaccines.
Most of the GP clinics are a mess because they don’t even know when they are getting the vaccine delivered.
I am at an absolute loss as to WHY this isn’t organised?
Greg Hunt needs to fire the person in charge for distribution and get someone in (maybe someone who already works on vaccine distribution ie.
use the monopoly money you gain to get real assets while its still worth something.
It is glorious, Fauci upon the masks, the masks upon Fauci and upon all of us.

As a 22 year old that made the choice to leave Barça for Dinamo?
If he had stayed at Barça, who knows.
As Olmo himself says, the guys who stayed there didnt get that many chances (Carles Aleñá, Marc Cucurella, Carles Pérez)
Not to mention it sounds like dogshit.
Swallow your stash, act like you are claustrophobic, resist arrest, say you cant beathe, cry etc.

yeah currently trying to fix it😐
We have nukes in TW, so I don't see the question there.
Same with bombarment—all it needs is an animation of a flying plane.
Well I have B-cups so everything is huge for me 😅
It's actually a shame to see a person who was actually a vidvaan and had potential do this to himself

Over usage of mousepad may degrade performance but if your a avid user you should be fine in my opinion you should get a non-coated since it would last longer and can be washed to restore glide.

I think they want to cause the target to psychologically erode as part of a sacrificial ritual.
If they can get the target into the mental health facility, homeless government program, prison, or forced to live in the home of a gangstalking family member (a spiritual and economic prison) they can trap them and continue the ritual to deprive them  of any righteousness, holiness or divine abilities they may have and take it for themselves.
They want to send the target to hell in their place.
it’s true.
love my tushy bidet.
None of those things apply: just a direct link to Amazon and a genuine question.

Chances are we’re going to see a renovated Highmark which is just  affordable enough to quell all but the most ardent anti-stadium crowd.
Anti-intellectualism, nationalism and a power hungry Right Wing ready and willing to wield them to their advantage.
Tbh those soups have so much sodium I hate them.
I like frozen veggies in the steam bags they last forever, and they sell frozen grilled chicken.
It’s definitely not the best but I’ll make chicken melts, or salads that I can eat slowly.
It sucks because I’m sensitive to textures including some foods so I don’t like many leftovers .
She makes me sick every time I see her face,I’ve never seen a more hateful evil heartless bitch in my life than what she is,that fact Ethan gave her a platform just shows what his true intentions is throughout all this it was financial and for subs and her it was all personal,like he knows what a bad person she is but ignored all she’s done to people some stuff that is absolutely disgusting but like Ethan her and his fans choose to ignore it because it’s all about getting pleasure of seeing other ppl crumble and loose everything so she can gain from it also financially but mainly what it states in this heading as people’s downfalls,none of this that she’s done is because she r Ethan cares because they don’t give a fuck what happened poor Hannah they used that as bait to draw everyone in,like she’s says little about SA but when she does it’s always about her and the fact she does this when SHE HERSELF SEXUALLY ABUSED JASON WHILE SLEPT AND LAUGHED ABOUT UT IS FUCKED UP,none of there side talks about Hannah only to defend when they are attacking David,his name was used in every tiktok post Twitter podcast and YouTube NEVER DOMS,they use Hannah’s trauma for there gain and it’s disgusting,I can’t wait for her to turn on Ethan because that’s what Trisha does best she has no friends for a reason that reason being she’s a bitter woman that can’t see anyone do well or be happy for anyone unless she’s involved,I pray Jason takes her to court he’s so much on her but doesn’t air it all over social media for sympathy like she does,CAN WE PLEASE GET HER ASS OFF SOCIAL MEDIA SHE DESERVES ALL THE HATE SHE GETS

Imagine how many drugged up people these employees deal with everyday for nobody to even give Floyd a second glance as he does his tyrone biggums impersonation around the store.
So what happens is that everyone buy used ones and not so good, we don't have students with puchner, heckel, Bell and etc.
It's more common to see old and questionable schreiber, moosmanns and Adler, wich have decades of use and only "work" but are not good.
I also refilled the tin with Oreo two-packs, so it'll actually be a sueprise for whoever finds it.

You can morph Wheat into Rye, but Rye Seeds won't be searchable.
WB had next to no haki at Marineford.
He had a heart attack when he tried to use conquerors and had blows on Aokiji and Akainu that observers thought killed them but since he wasn't using haki it didn't do anything.
Wouldn't it make more sense for him to come now that we have mass communication?
Also I meant he could have sacrificed himself as early as Adam and Eve, and then come back as a preecher or something now so everyone would know
I doubt birdshot had much of an effect it was probably mostly the muzzle gasses.

Anywho just some musings.
Then you work on identifying maladaptive beliefs that were formed in childhood that are operating under the surface today.
These inform our romantic partner choices, how we behave, feel, etc.
we can create our own self fulfilling prophecies!
Best way honestly is to jump in.
Join a cookgroup and absorb info like a sponge.
If you join one that doesn't suit you that's fine, you can leave and join a different one.
You need to always upgrading and improving.
Without a cookgroup you'll get a lot more noise than good info, but at least with one, the information is consolidated.
So absolutely by creating real jobs you reduce the need for welfare and that's positive and valid.
The issue with a jobs guarantee is that goes beyond creating real jobs and into the realm of makework and yes workfare.
The trick is to look away and talk to the immunizer about baseball or something.
If you get the shot while you're babbling it's a lot easier.
It also hurts even less if you let your arm go dead weight.
The limper your arm is, the easier it goes in.
I also take buproprion xl.
For me it is less effective than other stimulants, but the desire to abuse the modafinil is almost non-existent for me(I am recovering addict with 17 months clean).
It is somewhat difficult to compare since it is a completely different drug than traditional stimulant.
Modafinil has a complex mechanism of action which is different than other stimulants.
I can tell you basically every aspect of FC4's story.

My dad has been married almost 10 years now and although the woman has her share of things about her I don’t like, they make sense together and there are some similarities to my mother.
I visit them about once a year from LA (as well as other family I have in georgia where he moved).
I Talk to my dad on the phone every now and again.
But at the end of the day I’m an adult and I live on my own and take care of myself and live on the total other side of the country.
This woman is not my mom, she is not my stepmom, she is my dads wife and I don’t feel bad about that.
It’s almost unrealistic to expect otherwise.
There is definitely some times where things pop up where he wants us to do XYZ for her but it’s not all that often.
If he’s happy and she treats her well, great, but I have an entire life of my own.
If you live at home with them and do lots of things then that’s one thing but at 25 it is what it is.
You’re relationship is with your dad, if one builds with the others than great.
As long as there’s a shared respect with everyone, amazing.
I know right?!?!

> ... Domperidone which isn’t even **FDA approved** in the US can’t be taken by patients with heart conditions as it can cause deadly arrhythmia.
Patients in the US have to either illegally buy it from other countries and risk losing their meds to customs during the mailing process or they have to fight to get on it with compassionate use through the **FDA** and it can only be filled at one pharmacy in Texas and it isn’t covered by insurance either way you get it.

Once in the Interplanes, they will be hunted by demonic hordes trying to skin them alive and slave them.
If they roll lower than a 10, the hordes will catch them.
If they roll higher, they get to the Great Beyond.
Until now, every deceased character has been slaved by demons.
Idk if its just me, but I spent the last 6 hours today playing multi-player and had no glitches whatsoever.
I tried to recreate the stuff in the sub, but everything is working fine.

Grey zone lock down is worse than nothing in our "very low risk" district.
Our cases/100k are less than Toronto or Peele has ever been since March 2020.
We currently have less than a dozen active  and no hospitalized cases.
Anti-mask and Anti-vax are hot garbage.
A proactive approach which relies on our best current science and seeks to keep safe activities open is what we truly need.
We require leadership on the provincial level which is sorely lacking.
The real problem is just Vu, lol.
If you do need to take it you'll most likely have him, there's only one other prof teaching 272 I think.
Just try to keep your head down in class imo, he's abrasive, a jerk about other studies (likes to poke fun at liberal arts a lot) and overall just kind of an asshole.
He asks a question and if you give a slightly wrong answer he'll be sarcastic and make fun of what you said lol.
Rumor is he only gives one A per class, and honestly I feel like that's true because I got a C and I thought I did everything more than well (but I wouldn't know becauseee he does not give ANY grade updates!!)
What a Magnificent Dick-Sucking Wench  !

How do I uncrop this image?
Anyway, so I just noticed that if you get enough star pieces for a character like from event missions or from the Tazuna store, you can just outright buy the character I stead of having to roll for them.
Now that gives me incentive to actually buy star pieces from Tazuna's shop that I don't have yet...

You can definitely skip deadlifts just replace it with something that uses the hinge movement pattern and hits the hams and glutes.
Romainain deadlifts, and stiff leg deadlifts are both fantastic.
I guess you could also use a glute ham machine but I would try to have your main exercise to be a barbell lift so you can focus on progression.

Why are the Francophone countries better off post-colonialism than many other areas that were colonized and exploited for less time?
I would suggest that you look up a Hal Higdon or other half marathon training plan.
The key is to be consistent and slowly build up miles.
Each weekend should have a progressively longer run culminating in 11 or 12 mile run a few weeks before the race.
I train for my half marathons running 3x a week with strength training mixed in.
And full of my cum😉
And it would be worth even more if you could build four units the same lot and sell each for $600k.
That would be lower per unit cost, but higher value for the lot.
We can make this a win for people selling, building and buying.
You have no rhythm.

If I go more than a few days without a cigarette, the first few are quite a strong headrush and if I smoke two or three in a row like I usually would, it makes me nauseous and shaky for like half an hour.
Couple days of consecutive smoking and I can put down half a pack in an hour without a problem.
the brothers started the no bummers thing and the fandom has taken it an ran with.
Even if people try to be critical of the brothers outside of Specific fandom spaces it's like when a shark smells blood.
the Fandom finds them and often times harasses them.
and while they rarely if ever directly cite no bummers it can feel like an extreme version of that mantra is behind rabid defense of the brothers.
You are degenerate, noxious and depraved.
I feel debased just for knowing you exist.
I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.
I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are.
I mean rock-hard stupid.
Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid.
Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid.
You are trans-stupid stupid.
Meta-stupid.
Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know.

I wanted to buy a house with my bf but I have realized we should take a step back and RENT together and test out living- ALONE together before committing to that kind of thing.
Both of is have our own apartments rn though.
Tbh I LOVE having my own space.
It’s not the end of the world to say you want to move out and just live in your own apartment for a bit.
Maybe the bf will move in with you later on, but you should figure out the finances first.

Maybe he’s baiting you into doing a video on him as it’ll give him some attention.
I've completed 1-1 and obtained the Collection Data 1-1.
I went to 1-2 (which I have never even entered before) and there was no Collection Data.
I completed the mission there as well as the entire zone, and it sent me to another map (still in 1-2) which I also completed.
There was no Collection Data there.
So many people jump on the charizard hate train.
Yes TPC took it way overboard with the attention it gets but charizard was a huge factor as to why pokemon blew up imo.
I hope it works out for both of us buddy 🚀
This is a great example of just how hard it is to regulate system-wide risk.
Each of the PBs had no idea what the other PBs were doing with Archegos, so none of them knew the true extent of Archegos' leverage.
This led them to all extend more leverage than they probably otherwise would have, and also forced them to initiate the margin call because they couldn't be sure that any of the other banks would jump the gun (which is what happened).

The TUXEDO Pulse 14 is currently not planned to be continued with Ryzen 5 4600H.
The demand for this APU was /  is way way lower than for the 4800H considering the only a little higer price.
While the Ryzen 5's iGPU is not significantly slower, the 2 extra cores of the 4800H are absolutely worth the additional surcharge.
Memphis, just last year had Clarke and Ja on the all rookie first team, and Miami had Nunn and Herro on the first and second team respectively.
There's also been a few older examples like Philly with Saric and Embiid, Denver with Jokic and Mudiay, and Lakers with Kuzma and Lonzo who have had their rookie duos make the all rookie team.
We waste too much time on this... instead we should all get naked in one ginormous orgy

Yes, and also because of Golang's small, growable stacks.
Normal native code can't deal with the execution stack moving to a different place, which is also a big hindrance to interop.
That's what I meant by saying that Go is on its own platform.
It's a totally different model of execution and scheduling.
Just because Go doesn't have a VM like .NET or JVM, doesn't mean it's native.
In fact it could have a VM, Google just haven't gone to the trouble of formalizing and fleshing out one.

I can’t see, why after the fully stacked news pipeline for April, we shouldn’t go in big steps straight to our goal of 15$ (remember the  super low mcap?)
yes, all in the same internet.
I also test runing only my pc (the number 3) and is the same, there is no increase or decrease on tfuel/hour.
In 2013, I joined the Reddit running challenge and decided to run barefoot and in Vibrams as far as I possibly could!
I ran two sixes a day and switched to two 8s a day sometime in August.
It was crazy.
Knees were fine tho.
5015miles (and i won!)
I'm a designer and visual artist based in Amman, Jordan.
You can find this Space Cadet dude on my Redbubble shop "mjmasad".
I also have a small studio that does album art/posters for musicians and bands - "Studio Atheer".
It’s his relationship with Angel 🤫that kept him their instead of going to Buffy.
She had her shit figured out and don’t need no man but Angel was a mess and def needed one.
Consdering that almost all LGT style sabers are built with 30awg stranded shitty wire, you would think some 28awg PTFE would be just fine.
While I think it's funny, it's also a PR tactic.
They make a joke out of legimitate critique instead of adressing it, and when they keep releasing Primaris Lieutenants it looks like a continuation of the joke.
The end result is *still* that we're getting more Primaris Lieutenants, but GW have deflected some of the community dissatisfaction.
I'll post the rest of the designs I have done in a bit, there's some I haven't drawn get, but there's biker gang leader chihiro and soldier hifumi and swimmer hiro!
You got me 😂😂😂
INSTRUCTIONS UNCLEAR KEEP EXHALING WHILE PUNCHING OWN BALLSACK BUT THIS ISNT FEELING GOOD
-aggrieved Karen probably
I made salmon quiche with a mozerella salad for my SO's birthday dinner, and we just finished it between the both of us.
Probably wasn't the worst thing since it was mostly healthy, but definitely added up to probably a 1200-1400cal dinner...
ooooh between all the DTCC rule changes, the repo market actions, Archegos margin call and now IB/Futu margin calls?
Not looking to set a date or price target.... but UP and before 4/16 would be greeeeeat.
Based on his chubby cheeks, he’s prob an unneutered male, so that’s prob why!
Get him TNR’d as soon as you can because it’s kitten season!
E''kos sell decently well.
Frost protection ones sell the best I think with Naxx.
You have to do a questline in winter spring and then you keep a quest reward item on you (cache of Mauri I think it's called) and they drop off mobs you kill in WS.
Chillwinds drop the ones you want.
You can kill them in a group to farm the area fast as every member in the party that has the cache in their bags can pick one up from the mob.
You will be rewarded 🚀🌕
So I guess this puts to bed "Is UCLA a blue-blood anymore?"
Modern Mardu Pyro is a grindy midrange deck, nothing like this.
I think it sounds like a fine strategy, but like you said, you'd never be as aggressive and explosive as this deck
I'm kinda liking how they are going outside the norm for most of the enemy combinations for card designs.
Few blros/lorehold cards are focused on combat.
Izzet is not about small spells/storm.
Simic is same ol' shit.
As far as we can see, Golgari is different from what have been done, too.
We still need to see what design window orzhov will go.
It seems like group effects and buffs.
Hand diamond 💎🤲
If it took 5 people like Thomas Andre to defeat that dragon Kasier, then imagine how powerful it is.
Good thing SJW didn't get it's Shadow or he would have been stupidly OP
I'm no good at chemistry or stuff like that but I'm good with literature shit.
Not very useful when I'm druggie tho.
Wish I had your chem skills!
I'm sure you had to do a lot of work to get where you are with things!
Keep us in the loop if you can!
Yeah I already love my 4* Felmina.
That dress/pose gives me serious flashback to parasite eve vibes.

I think a huge part of why so many people cheat in Tarkov is:
What's the next prediction that you know of?
If it turns out to be right, I'll be much more open-minded about this.
Both vbios and sbios.
My wife's bf likes to lay some pipe, so Imma upvote
I hope its fields.
I think they are both top teir prospects.
But for the style of offense they are bringing in, the quick release and mid range accuracy that Wilson would probably fit better.
After the change 2 med crit and 1 small crit should provide enough along with 2 wamdus spears to reach 100%.
Hopefully this frees up grid slot ls for something that'll help magna more.
My answer when I would get frustrated is the 3x ATM12 VGL-3.
That thing is usually a sandblaster but the TAG helps to take components and kill.
I don't run a light TAG.
I just sacrifice the jumpjets for regular TAG and more ammo.
I try to play it a bit dangerous but also try to make sure I'm near something fairly tanky.
Doesn't always work out but I've had more good runs than bad on that fucker.
Once had a DM let my Orc party member throw my halfling character in combat, I rolled high on all my checks and it was legit one of the most sessions we ever had.
We still bring it up years later.
WFH also makes it possible to move to somewhere with low housing costs.
Like some village where you can get a ton of space quick.
I have to thank u/emmiedoo for this, she helped me make my mind about the lift kit!
Agreed, but I get where they're coming from.
The whole played-out "one death is a tragedy" thing.
With numbers like this, with stuff this big and messed up, it becomes hard you emotionally connect.
6 billion is way too much to get a grip on, let alone more.
It's nearly impossible to really engage with it.
Because people want to be more than just cool/badass.
Men want to *be* Indiana Jones (young and fit and funny, and get the young damsel NOT 60+ year old Marion Ravenwood, etc.)
and women want to be with him.
That’s the classic action hero trope.
Like James Bond.
Things like the quarry are kind of what makes minecraft great.
Is it more important to preserve natural beauty or to advance?
Throw some pretty stone pathways around the edge, some lanterns and some fencing/walls.
Maybe some nice stars going around the edge all the way to the bottom.
Alternately, fill it with water, maybe make a channel to the nearest ocean.
I have been trying to contact them but they redirect the call to another country (HOng Kong) and their E-mail facility is suspended for a while.
The madolf letter is also very smart.
I mean he'll April is supposed to be autism acceptance month and here we are comparing this person to a neurotypical person and drawing conclusions that could very well harm this person if they were to know about it.
That's what I care more about.
This poor dude doesn't deserve this
Just kidding.
Actually your answers are valid as well, and I’m getting better answers than I’ve thought I would.
You need to understand that your friend never intended or wanted to hurt you.
He has just matured differently than you have.
To you it feels almost like a break-up, and to him it was never as emotional as it was to you, so he really just can't feel that way at all.
To him it was just something that happened that wasn't a big deal.
No friggin way
This show has gotten to the point where the adaptation makes such comedic differences from the novel that when it got to the fivesome, I just sat there laughing cuz of the absurdity of it.
Honestly, they're better off that way.
Marinette has backbone and chloe isn't a bitch, it's a win win
It runs pretty well with 2080S, medium raytracing at 4k with DLSS
Way back in the day I used to listen to talk radio to pass the time at work.
I usually turned off his show but the one thing I clearly remember is how he sexually harassed his secretary on-air, saying that she had an ass shaped like an apple.
Yep, even has a sign on the door “NO MOMZ ALLOUD”

Interesting weird: Olympic Orchids Nightflyer.
A really realistic smelling scent, makes me feel like I stand in a wet cave, some greenery around, bat screeching while the sun is sinking.
I wouldn't wear it but it's an experience.

I'm on my fourth and final day of the cleanse and I weigh 47kg.

Pierre said blanchissage and they immediately fucking scored, way to go (still love u)
Never know.
They biggest thing about reclassing to combat arms MOS is whether or not you want to deploy in a combat arms MOS.
You’re not going to get quality training when you’re just drilling anyhow (in most cases) apart from maybe your AT’s or a JRTC or NTC rotation.
I don’t remember the last time I’ve trained in my MOS apart from those instances.
>!Comstar presence Tag Team, and Star League presence Search Denial can directly have ComStar involvement.
They will appear a lot more on higher difficulty planets.
Outside of those missions, any mission involving other enemies or allies can have ComStar show up as well.
I tell him that there is subreddit for this kind of cases (asking show by seeinh pic of it).
We got 15k in September, 15k in October, 17k in November, and 20k in December.
So 77k.

Hughes is playing with Bratt and Palms who are doing fine recently.
Time for him to score himself bc he’s certainly driving play enough.
I disagree with the last part.
Maybe covid and scheduling has hurt us more than others but it’s not a big enough difference to where we’d jump out of 27th in the league.
Yah I totally knew what you meant, just wanted to make sure the newbie did 🖖
I need it all night 💦
Actually thats counter intuitive technically the most 'sane and rational route' is to be agnostic.
Let me explain we neither know if god exists or not, you are on he doesn't exist side while the other redditor is on does exist side.
Very interesting concept!
Super cool that they could switch to see the gravitics, that section was especially dope to me
Americans racialize this but in the UK this is denoted by accent - Scots, Welsh, Irish and Cockney is just Not Cricket and their concerns can be dismissed - and in Canada it is denoted by accent *plus* bilingualism - Laurentian English and Laurentian French as learned at McGill and Concordia or else you just aren’t respectable.
best way to fight a Karen is use their logic.
Tell her what would she do if a random kid went into her apartment and enjoyed watching her shower?
She'd probably call the kid a perv and scream at parents and call cops
At least r/NovoAmor is chill.
I don't play PVP so can't share tips on that area but in terms of playstyle, I chain pull (I guess you could call it) where by when one pack is nearly done, I'll break off and go pull a second in to keep the momentum going.

This was really, really well done.
The movie was able to provide a happy ending without completely trampling on Violet's character development.
Even if there was a bit of tradeoff to be had there, oh my god did Violet's facial movements and emotions more than make up for it (anytime I saw our girl in the second half of the movie, it would cause tears to well up).
And the "side" plot about Yurith was beautiful.
Leave it to Violet Evergarden to introduce a character and make me cry over them.
LaCHAN rules.
Btw if location is what you’re worried about, I zoomed 5 Econ Warwick students and they said there are so many things to do in places nearby (cafes, bars, museums) — it will especially be fun with your WA close knit friends !

Sometimes you never know how you're gonna handle something till it happens.
Broke my first bone recently and I unexpectedly enjoyed myself throughout the whole ordeal, also while most people hate covid restrictions and lifestyle adjustments I like it and im not looking forward to going back to normal.
If you warned me about either my arm breaking or covid in advance Id probably start panicking, dreading, and stressing about doing all I can to avoid it.
If I was successful I would of missed out.
This comment made me so happy 🥺
Hey, man, the world is a strange place, full of crazy people.
My gun is the thing that makes me feel safe.
The last thing I want is to die because some crazy Trans fucker shanked me with a kfc spork because I wouldn’t date a “woman” with a penis.
Really happy
neat, can't for the fucking life of me sit through a zanny vid, but it's cool to run into big names on games you play.

I don't know about Wilburn Construction however I worked with McLeay Building Company.
Top-notch general contractor to have on your side.
They do both commercial and residential work.
Lmao, are Taemin's fingers ok?
Same for me: TradeRepublic
After that, both changed that and softened up.
It didn't cost Le Pen a lot and she won big time at the EU elections.
However, from JLM's stance, softening up to pro-EU and in general to soft-libs cost him a great deal and he did disastrously.
Ever since BUZZCUT dropped he’s been tweeting... and deleting of course
If you want to see how that insanity came to be watch Mrs. America.
The creator of conserveapedia is the main characters son.
It's even sadder when you know the creator has a gay brother.
For some reason we as a society treat violent deaths as WAY worse than other deaths even if they have the same end result and were both preventable.
Imagine if a mass shooting had killed 146 people yesterday, that would be in the news ALL YEAR.
But about the same amount in California will die today of covid (in the least deadly part of the pandemic in months!)
and it will just be a number in the chart, and apart from the families of the victims nobody will care.
This is not to say that covid is the number one most important thing in the world and nothing else matters, it's to say that the danger to any individual from mass shootings (and violent crime/terrorism in general) is dramatically overstated if all you did was read the news.
You have to understand that before anyone is declaring ML is copying LoL, one has to fact-check IF LoL itself has copied/stolen from DotA, the source.

Christians often fail to emulate Christ, but non Christians aren’t even attempting to, for the most part.
So for the worldly man to judge God’s people is upside-down & insane.
But they can’t see it.
Let’s be careful not to judge them but be a good example.
At those gear levels, GBA Unique (the one that gives you the pre taunt) or Palp lead, first.
If you go for Palo lead, next do Vader MM.
If you go for GBA, you can move over to empire after.

Empire will counter similar gear Geo's, but struggle with JKR.

Lmao, I keep hearing "US propaganda" being thrown to everything nowadays.
Actually, as an active Mormon, I took that shit seriously.
Yes, sometimes I red-palmed it, and I wouldn't take the Sacrament for a MONTH.
But, as I said, all the Mormon males I knew had pre-marital sex.
Some had a LOT of it, but they all partook, and took the Sacrament, and thought nothing of it.
My kids might be in trouble.
I drove through the tip of one county to get to a 3rd county and deliver, but all within the same metro-area hospital system.

The class is very structured--we have a reading and reading quiz due before class and in class we solve problems on a worksheet together (worksheet due every Friday).
Our grade consists of quizzes, section and lecture worksheets, two midterms and comprehensive final.
The professor seems very passionate about physics and getting students to understand it, however, she is very intent on us doing the problems her way.
Lmaooo, I remember playing this level and I almost did the same thing.
Imma hit up my friend and we'll play it again, thanks for making me laugh in a long time.
You're right, anime includes tentacle rape hentai, what was I thinking?

Hey everyone that is depending on trey trades just stop for a minute.
This man had medical issues, so he can’t post everyday on social media and post those vids we all love so much.
Try going out and doing your own DD.
I know we all want it so easy, but sometimes you gotta work for those tendies.
Again he is going to post the video with jordan( wolf of wall street) soon.
Give him some time because imagine if you could barely see( thats one of the medical problems he is experiencing right now)
Have them help set it up!
Name it!
Get buy in.
Time out is you against them-calm down corner is you helping them manage emotions.
Bridge spam isnt the highest skill deck in the world.
But generally on high ladder its a very high skill deck for multiple reasons.
You have to be able to count cycle and elixir super well.
This allows you to know what cards to use to pressure with and when to attack.
Without doing this you wont know how and when to pressure.
75% of MUs will be in favor of your opponent when playing bridge spam.
This is due to the large majority of the meta HCing bridge spam.
Pretty much every MU is played differently so you need to be able to play with different play styles for each specific deck.
Overall when comparing bridge spam to other decks, it has a much higher skill cap.
thank you.
i forgot about the tyranid missions.
there are options it seems.
just seems odd that the star map is hardly used.

I think this was about the mid-Grift period.
Oh yes.
Made a lot easier because I prefer shorter stories.
The first comic I read was an old Batman giant with all origin stories.
I read those dozens and dozens of times.
Other early comics were 70s Superman comics out of the dollar box, I also read these like crazy and still have a couple of them.
I still read them probably every couple of years anyway- if I'm not reading them now and then, no need to keep them around IMO...
I’m also a size 11 for yeezy, are they loose or kind of tight?
I kinda prefer them to be a little loose instead of a little tight
I was terrified of the jellyshroom caves.
Not because of the worms or anything but because that psychic scene where the sea emperor talks to you for the first time triggered just as I was going in so I thought there was some huge monster in there
I’m a 2/12er, and finally got through to someone at the IRS yesterday.
She said I was randomly flagged for ID verification.
I have not gotten a letter from them, and she said if I hadn’t called, I could have been waiting for months to get one.
Because I called, it was brought to my attention, I did the verification online, and now it “should” finish processing.
I highly advise anyone that is “still processing” like I am, to call them.

We share the workload in different ways.
He works full-time on a rotating schedule usually 10-12 hour shifts.
I work part time (30-hours a week) I do most of the cooking and cleaning because I am home more than he is.
He manages the finances, and I manage the household logistics.
He manages the yard work/ I do the gardening.
These divisions just work for us.
When he is not working, we take care of things equally.
I cook dinner while he sets the table, after dinner he may clean the kitchen while I bathe the kids or vice-versa.
Our kids get 3 stories every night and we alternate that task.
Honestly, the biggest thing is communication.
We share a google calendar and discuss MD appointments, events, needs of children.
If I need him to do something I ask... and he does it.
We are united in a common goal.
Is life easy?
Not always... but We have each other to lean on.
Thanks for answering my actual question, do you know if anyone has done Spyderco blades using that method or are they selling brittle junk fixed blades?

This is good because I was forced to buy online because tweeds and all the others were 2.5-4 times the price than online was.
So instead of buying $40 in store for a month or whatever I would buy $150 online to make the shipping more worth while, and I was good for 6-8 months.
Now that I can pick it up for a modest price I'll do it.
I don't mind even paying $30 in store if online is $20.
I have it that day, no risk of losing it in the mail, and I don't have to buy in bulk if I don't want to.
No, but it was one of few brand names I got so I wore the shit out of it 🤷🏻‍♀️
An upvote for Mad Mack!
That it does.
We need to be telling ourselves as many times a day about the price going to AMC10K.
I personally do AMC20K but each to their own.

Cute cavalier ❤️ I had a ruby named Brady
I think I realized the problem with the timeskip that I couldn’t at first get my finger around:
Oh it’s yours?
I thought the set up looked like OzTalksHW from yt lol nice set up tho I wish!
if  anyone wants a free nordvpn, hulu or disney+ account dm me
it's normal to a degree.
clean it off, reassemble, see if that helps your concerns, and if not, maybe time to try a new pad or paste or come with with a different game plan.
Heh shiet Bastet is also Dennis Reynolds ex wife
That's better bby 🥰
Awwwww man tbh biggest L ever having bought that shit ass game
What’s the hole for ?
And if it’s a gout doohickey why is it upholstered on both sides?
Did Laura circle back??
The visionary is stronger.
Gremmy is not
different factors, some crown their highest damage dealers, some crown their favourite waifus/husbandos - personally i crown my dps
just to nitpick the strength of dodge is that it breaks aim assist, on PC that can maybe turn a gunfight if you're skilled but on console it's an encounter reset
Could u pls upvote this comment and some of my other posts 😘
ggez nice tutorial
Barely legal pussy the best🤤😏
I’d love to see a star fragment giveaway OR the houseplant/nature-y items
Fair enough.
🤷🏼‍♀️ It’s a nuanced issue.
Is Fuentes convincing enough to avoid him, or is it worth getting out there how toxic his views are while potentially converting some of his followers?
To return the favour please upvote my pinned art post in my profile and leave it a comment ;-) That would be so kind!
>OMG, haha, no, not what you're thinking!
You're correct in me ranting in emails (which I have done) and having some influence.
Practically anyone has an impact, whether that's small or large.
When it's in-group, then changes are implemented quickly and efficiently.
I'm a bold person and a social butterfly in general.
If I can share other students' main issues with the campus and suggest ideas to improve to our Ombuds/Chancellor office, it can help them be more aware then takes steps in resolving the problems by "planting seeds."
Also, maybe they can gradually reallocate funds when necessary so that other students can have a better experience at LB.
I'm about to graduate soon and don't want other students to go through what I did with the runarounds.
😯 I think is very cute!
Lol Contrapoints is like head of BreadTube.
She's a leftist through and through.
I’m really sorry.

Very impressive tent.
The two ships resemble elongated Arwings from Nintendo and Dylan Cuthbert’s StarFox.
Sshhiitt wheres this pool...and i promise not to jerk off at ur window while u change 😊😉😳
Blackcliff weapons are not necessary to complete the current content in the game, you can do fine with just craftable or 3star weapons.
Older article said TD could not but u can on Fidelity and ETrade and Interactive Brokers.
Is that true?
I have TD.
He hits the open man.
They have to either score themselves or find the open man since Dame has 2 on him momentarily
This is not how Shirunui was meant to be played :(
I'm starting to like mmfd
113k attack?
Even for a metal?
I have Metal Catwoman maxed and with damage augments I did not get close to that much.
My ipad’s screen pro model A1701 started becoming yellow around the edges.
Is this normal?
Can it be reversed in any way?
Oh my bad, actually rewatching it Eric from True Blood says, “What the hell is that?” That’s it.

TL;DR. Use TailsOS on a USB drive with a VPN service.
What’s with asia and subguns?
Obviously the mp5 is legacy but the mpxs are new.
Looks exactly the same as it did in Elementary school back in like '93.
Probably still tastes shittily delicious.
Knowing that your just lubing guts I'd start small.
Just like drugs, take half, you can always take more later.
Or dooku’s extra appearances, or a lot of clone/droid skins.
My dad suffers from anxiety in many ways, and hasn't really been able to work for years because of it--it became debilitating to the point where he'd suddenly faint and have amnesia for a few hours (saw it happen, and it scared the crap out of me).
Other times, it would be like he had symptoms of stroke or TIA, but everything would be fine.
One day, I visited my mom's parents (may they rest in peace), and Grandpa went off on how Dad had lost another job working overnight because he just didn't want to work and that he is lazy (he's not--Dad always had been the hardest working guys I've ever known; turns out, working overnights didn't agree with him and it triggered even more severe anxiety).
It's people like my grandfather that make it hard to even discuss meds in many cases, and it's still hard to get rid of that stigma.
What if every night y'all went out, this girl wing-maned you?
If she's HB7+, she'll provide huge social value.
I'm buying more... it's had an insane sell off just because it came from a SPAC so it's lumped in with all the other garbage SPACs that plummeted 60%.. tons of cash, lot of accretive deals made recently.
Looks like they gave terrible guidance though partially because of the chip shortage.
Man… I sold my 1080 after just getting my 3070,
I seem to be able to only fit maybe 4-5 games on at a time.
Mostly thanks to some beefy 130GB+ games.
If we’re talking just the standard set, you’re def caught up in the hype.
With the exception of boros getting an interesting new play style and a couple of mythics, so far the set seems pretty bland (it has a lot of flavor though I’ll give it that).
This is the first set in a while that I plan on not buying a prerelease kit and only buying the 1 or 2 cards I want.
Are the leaves fuzzy?
Could be peperomia incana
Lol first time on this sub and you guys are harsh, but I am here for it.
I see them 😏
Thank you, it really is.
I have also started tinkering around with emulators and BOTW at 60 fps is really great
A milled AK (depending on your income) will for most break the bank.
Your main/only option is an Arsenal Sam7sf.
It has a milled receiver and side folding stock.
It’s the best milled AK47 you can get right now.
They will run you between $1800-$1900.
This is a buy once cry once purchase.
Those AK’s will last for a LONG time.
The paint job won’t, but not much you can do about that besides getting it re-done by a reputable company.
When was your elite eight game 🤔
A- It just depends on the power imbalance, and besides, fictional power imbalances aren't exactly as bad as real world ones where someone is actually in danger.
Power imbalance between 14 year old and malicious all-powerful god is definitely bad, and people believe that that story is not only true, but a story of morality.
Used to be part of a forum called Digital Warfare 24/7 back in MW2-Jetpacks before the site died.
which was basically a dedicated CoD site.
They didn’t even talk about Comp much but I ended up seeing a Bo2 Scump clip in a dead thread and the rest is history.
These are awesome.
Do you happen to have any shots of McKeesport, especially Grandview?
it’s to late for that 🌝

Am I forgetting the timeline a little bit or wasn't she shown the audio *after* the Coachela thing?

The only time I've witnessed the SS change dynamically is in Half-life Alyx, because it's a feature "built into" the game.
(nothing to do with OTT setting)
Mr Thornton, be still my beating heart!
Loved Sandition.
Rose Williams is so charming and has such a period face.
This happened to me and I hadn’t handed in any assignments or done any quizzes or hand-ins for the whole semester, and I could most definitely not afford a counsellor.
Do they provide free counselling services or ”student therapy services” at your University?
They’re usually free or for a small fee abd they’re always SUPER nice and understanding.
You will have to likely redo your course.
I had to redo the course but instead of getting a F (fail) grade, I got a DNC - did not complete.
This shows that there is something that stopped you from completing your course instead of you saying ”fuck it” and failing.
Good luck!
How long has he been on the doxycycline?
Lameness switching from limb to limb is pretty typical of tick disease (especially Lyme).
I'm not sure how quickly you would see improvement in the lameness from the Doxy because tick disease is so stubborn.
Tick disease can also trigger autoimmune problems.
I got in about five tries before I was stopped.
Red fingernails wrapped themselves around my waist and lifted me into the air.
I'd like to think that I was brave during this moment but I'm pretty sure I was screaming.
My limbs flailed around me and my throat was hoarse by the time It stopped moving.
The demon stared at me, its eyes a deep red and sighed, “All you humans are the same, Idiots all of you.
Did you think that would work?
I've already had to eat 10 women before who all thought Id be stupid enough to let them kill me.
Looks like your number 11.” And before I could scream, I died.
In fact today, I glanced at the first kiddo I lost to the pandemic of both Addiction and Covid.
No one will convince me her OD wasn’t directly related to the above.
Single-player, somehow has a similar problem which seems to also be visual.
Depends on your build, though the Baemore is pretty solid throughout the game.
When I say I like the stock I’m not joking.
One of the reasons is because GameStop is in an EXCELLENT position to become the VR hub.
Maybe one day we can have GameStop holo decks 🤤
You can acid wash the filters by putting them in a big plastic container and filling will water and then adding muriatic acid.
2 parts water 1 part muriatic let sit for about 6-8 hours then wash off afterwards

Still waiting for the ss triarc barrel to come back in stock.
I'm predicting a multi-goal game from Garland.
I'd argue that at 2016 Worlds NA also had a big impact on the meta.
NA was the only region really playing Syndra prior to worlds (there were a couple picks in China and one game in EU compared to a 72% presence in NA playoffs), then Worlds rolls around and she's picked/banned in basically every game.
I also specifically remember Monte making fun of TSM for banning Olaf, a pick literally no one else was playing, in all 3 of their games against CLG, then Worlds comes along and he's the #3 in presence overall (this one is a little less convincing because the two S-tier junglers Gragas and Rek'Sai were nerfed in the patches between playoffs and Worlds, but it's unlikely that Olaf would shoot so high up without a buff if there wasn't something there already).
Just lose two FFAs and jump in shipment hardpoint.

Only if your fucking.
But when you know that you forget to check the calendar and you know that you lose lists, then you need to change your approach!
I’ve finally started using a bound A4 weekly planner where I write everything - and I mean everything, work and not-work - in it.
If it’s not in it I very possibly could forget it, but I’m definitely not misplacing that chonky ass book.
And if you’re digital than use alerts!
Why though?
I’m a relatively new player and he seems like one of the fairer characters, he can’t convert massive combos off of one mid, he doesn’t have a move that instantly takes him across the screen, his mixups are a little more simple to exit than say Laura’s or Mika’s.

It’s okay, I’m half tempted to write some CSP’s and then sell CC’s to my downvoters.
Good plan of attack though buddy.
Thanks for the link, compare.
No, i didn't know about that site.
I got my infos about bands and records by several years hanging in HC Punk scene, buying records, reading fanzine, books and talkung to active partecipants.
I have no DLC as the price of game to price of DLC ratio to idiotic.
Game is $20 and goes on sale for much less on PS4 often, and 1 DLC is 75% of base game price.
Now $30 for all DLC past present and future honestly isn't that bad of a deal considering normally it's over $100.
But I only care for like 3 weapons so still not worth it for me.
Luckily you guys on PC sometimes get discounts on DLC and I would assume the season pass at some point.
Here on PS4 never have I ever seen DLC on sale.
If the season pass goes on sale on PS4 for $15 before the heat death of the universe, then sure I'll toss them some money.
They haven't got a buck out of me since I got it free on PS+ forever ago.
I see.
But will you say it's enough to just learn from the ACTEX?
though compliments from CA might be helpful
Risk-free means it does not vary regardless of change in returns of risky asset so their covariance and therefore correlation is zero.
I can agree to that...
I'd have WOTW1 as the hardest and Exes 2nd.
Doesn't need to be eren surviving for yuki kaji to voice act.

What happened to 4/17/20 $200p?
This sub loves a good stonkradamous, but ya'll might be better off listening to Ms Cleo.

They're using their mystic powers to downvote me.
Ahhh I understand.
Yeah, I usually run at least one Bulky mon that wouldn’t need many shields (Umbreon in GL, Snorlax and Lapras in UL) so makes sense that adding a 2 shield sim would bring everything down.
This meme needs Luffy with a Kong Gun Bird.
I'm hoping its just the GM rushers again and the Portal players will die down after 1-week again.
Mikan is now only about 2 months old, her sister Baku is still smol while Mikan is already the size of my one year old girls.
I am concerned about Mikan's size.
When I first got her she didn't look brindle at all, and only a few weeks ago I learned that brindles get fat easily.
I leave them one bowl of pellets and one bowl of mix, fresh veggies and fruits here and there, and all other girls had no problem with the diet I provide.
Mikan is the only one that got fat so quick.
Is there anyway I can do to not let her get fat?
Do I need to seperate her?
That's the one; wasn't so wrong about the title after all 😅
Manchester had the Mobikes.... until they got so abused that they were removed.

It is not about which App, it's about which investments.
Here is a list of places you can try, your own bank can do it, CashApp, Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade, We-Bull.
Which is best depends on what you use it for.
For newbies RH is pretty good, for semi-Pro TD works great.
there were 2 carts, OP shoulda mentioned that
I guarantee you that Covid would have been already over and done with if people weren't such contrarian fucktards who can't even spare a single thought for those around them.
My sister was sexually assaulted multiple times while serving in the army.
I had a guy friend who had to fight off 3 fellow soldiers who attempted to force him to perform oral sex on them.
When my high-school aged daughter started getting mail from the US Marines, it all went promptly into the trash.
For example, you could work out a deal with a new tenant where after they are approved, sign their lease, and you get confirmation from the landlord that all is good, you cut the new tenant a check for $2k.
It works out in everyone’s favor.
Landlord gets all the expected rent from the new tenant.
The new tenant gets 2 free month rent (a 33% discount).
And you saved $4k.
Obviously you could offer no discount or a smaller discount to see what interest is out there.
sort of, `std::forward` has a weird implementation with two overloads.
but doing it this way ends up being equivalent because of reference collapsing rules.
I just recently read a paper on William Lane Craig's Kalam where he discusses the ramifications of denying the cause premise which relegates all things to "inexplicability", effectively.
the quote that got me was:
Windowstil could do with sorting.
And the dresser with the consoles on it, fix that up a bit too.
Also I wonder if medicorp or whatever could be another source of money 👀
Probably Sergi as a backup to Frenkie and Busi
Yes no one should be telling anyone who to pick!
I’ve actually seen it the most at higher ranks where someone complains the whole game and barely tries because someone instalocked their main.
Not weird at all.
I would gladly accept 👌
I mean giannis is dpoy.
As long as he's good enough not to be a target and helps out jokic at the rim I'm good.
He had a couple blocks in today's game.
We just need our defensive rating at ~10 cos we have a top 5 offense, n that's including all our shitty quarters where ppl sleepwalk on the court and an anemic bench.
I’ve seen a few great derivatives of Teresa like Tera, Reese, Tessa, Tesa, And Resa.
Cia could be a good form of Hortencia.
As for combinations of the two, maybe Hortessa could work?
Or Tescia?
Once you see this dude once, you have seen everything he does lmao.
Its always a very bad joke but made extremely long, and one of the characters is always him with a whatever that is on his head representing a woman.
Thats pretty much it xD
9 years* (I'm sure it was a autocorrect fail)
I don't think she's *gaslighting* you.
It's not clear from your post which part you think involves gaslighting.
It just sounds like you both have some things to learn (doesn't everyone?
), and that the two of you can't communicate or handle yourselves very well (perhaps because you both have some things to learn) - and from the sounds of things it does seem for the best that you're not involved with one another any more.
You might want to think about what it is you get from sharing photos of your experiences online.
This is because Northern Ireland bizarrely chose to prioritise every single HSC worker, rather than just the frontline, as the JCVI advised.
I know healthy people in their 20s who have worked from home the past year who got the vaccine before people in their 70s simply because they had an HSC badge.
Dept of Health is grossly corrupt.
mmmm i oike it, but would be nice to release Mind-controlled Batman too!
It's important that people as dangerous as Force-sensitives are indoctrinated into the Jedi way of life.
We saw what two Sith did to the galaxy.
Uh....No, I asked a series of questions that progressively got more invasive to see where they would draw the line.
I never argued that their point was invalid because of the examples I gave, which would have been a strawman.

The dog meat part is true because dog meat tastes way better than steak 😋
This Greg Kelly guy on one of those weirdo Maga news channels might be my new favourite.
“SMOKING WEED (aka GRASS) is NOT a good idea.
I’ve tried it (back in the day) and it was WORSE than anything that happened to HUNTER BIDEN.
I “toked up” with some buddies in Kentucky and woke up 4 days later in Nairobi, Kenya.
With no idea what happened.
DON’T DO DRUGS.”
Every single branch is terrible when it comes to this aspect.
The Air Force is better than other branches and if my daughter ever told me she were dead-set on joining the military, I would want it to be the Air Force over any others, BUT the Air Force still has toxic leaders, and has had a few prostitution rings recently busted up, even with senior EO/sexual harassment prevention leadership in the rings.
So it’s better, but only marginally.
I had to fill out a self-observe scale.
It asked questions related to ADHD like if we feel we get distracted by lights/sound or if we don't finish things.
I then had to take two observation reports for two people in my life.
For me I was no longer in school so I had no one to refer to in school life.
I also haven't worked because I'm chronically ill so I didn't have that.
I had to rely on a family member and friend.
The observation scale had the same questions as the self-observe one, but worded differently.
Pretty much the same though.
Gotcha with an upvote!

The burger is just a basic burger, but the fries are straight cut from potatoes in the restaurant and not processed with other shit like every other fast food.

Hey u/frootbabie1!
Been hitting the thigh master Torgo?
I think it could sway some, not all stakers.
But maybe it doesn't have to sway all?
Perhaps all it has to do is sway enough to greatly help out pools with low amounts of stake.
That probably doesn't require the full-ish pools to lose too much of what they have.
Also, it's something that many who are already used to saying, "large/small" would never get on board with, dismissing it as foo foo, shee shee psycho babble.
I simply view it as a misnomer that makes the wrong type of pool attractive.
Yes to all❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥 🔥🔥💔❤️
When the server process terminates (the program closes), the HashMap gets deleted from memory.
If you want to store data outside of the memory, you need to store it in a file.

Whoa that's cool.
Now thinking about it as Luffy's opponents, Kaido is kinda opposite to Katakuri.
While Katakuri always dodges attacks thanks to his future sight, Kaido always takes attacks head-on cause they're not gonna hurt him.
We saw Katakuri getting hit before, and now we see Kaido dodged, ... wow our Luffy has really come a long way.... maybe we will see snake man advanced CoA version next.
Yeah, that's exactly what I was talking about.

You can cup/FP or do AeroPress with 10g or so.
Have you tried the darkweb?
Again, mad props to your mindset but please tale it easy and don't rush.
That break sounds gnarley as fuck.
Shitting on DeBeers is pretty reasonable but the idea the have a monopoly or still hoard diamonds is wildly outdated.
They still 100% market them as ultra rare or special....just like every luxury brand.
I mean does anyone really think a Prada purse is made of materials that are worth $2,300?
Hell no, its all marketing as you said

Not only that, it came within 2 weeks of when I got it.
Also applied to upgrade to the royal indigo and they sent it to me without having to pay the fee!
I know CDC has done some shady stuff in the past but my experience has been good with them so far.

Obviously not financial advice, but my plan is to get a gun, and a boat.
A gun I can carry and conceal easily, chambered in something common (9mm, .40, .45).
A boat between 45’ and 65’, with a good inventory of sails, a water maker, and some old style nav equipment that I can live aboard and keep underway with a partner and maybe one or two other people that bring a skill to the table, and get to whatever beach in the world least affected by the fallout.
Good luck 🦍.

For those of you into shipping,(like me, lmao) what are some ships in Pokémon that you dislike?
For me, some would have to be stuff like Dawn x Cynthia, May/Brendan x Steven Stone, Lillie/Gladion x Lusamine, and any human x Pokémon stuff
Let's hope so!👍
Even if he is an immature twit I think it’s going a bit far how people are making out he’s such a bad person, some people are just immature, and have immature humour, and they don’t think until after they’ve caused distress or something .
But it’s because they don’t think.
If they did think “oh that would actually be quite cruel” then they might not do it, but some people only realise that after the fact.
I get judging that about him, but it’s like people think that “yeh because he’s so terrible for not thinking about things like that and because I now have this negative opinion of him he must be some disgusting predator too because he’s dating a 23 yr old, also I bet he thinks women belong in the kitchen and he probably kills kittens too just cus he must be terrible in every way cus of this thoughtless prank he pulled”

GENERLIZATION IN THE TITLE
Theyre only managing because theyre fighting side by side.
Individually they will definitely.
Law's room is ineffective against the emperors, Kidd's and Killer's attack doesnt do much damage.
Zoro only cut Kaido for a moment and thats that.
Lufy against Kaido one on one is lit though.
Might drool on the altar some 🤤
i think soreness ratings also need to be taken with a pretty hefty grain of salt.
sometimes, you don't get sore because your chosen exercises barely stimulate the target muscle at all, but are super systemically fatiguing, so you have to make sure your SFRs are all in order first.
soreness is also confounded by the recovery time of different muscles & your training frequency.
at 6 weekly sessions, my rear delts are almost always a 1 or 2 on soreness, but if i added 2-3 sets a week i'd be doing 60 rear delt sets a week by week 3 of the meso.

It’s because they are truly capable of listening and their hands/embouchure/whatever are well-trained enough to react to what their ears process.
I honestly had no issue hearing her lyrics so didn't think about that sorry 😂
This is a ~7yo cartoon for pete’s sake
They could pave this path.
If they didn't build this stupid one before, that'd've meant more grass.
Sorry Brother, but Im actually looking for more.
I did see them on ebay but with a high premium around 54$ a bar.
Good luck🥈
You are perfect, I like a mess and like it very dirty just like those sexy feet 🐽 I hope you have a musky dick, balls, and ass for me to sniff and lick.
vampiric regeneration, what is homecraft energy?
this isn't explained and google says its not an existing thing.
why add a pool of dice instead of just allowing them to use hit dice which work the same way but add constitution modifier to the healing and are d8's instead of d6's
Same problem, also the right stick on the dualsense is registering as the mouse.
That’s pretty damn good looking.
Not fish but in the Covid market that looks like a decent 70+ % which is more than twice over the average purity right now.
It’s never fully accurate to judge by just a photo but just my thoughts, some rocks look really oily and shiny on the upwards of 80% while others look maybe 65% in this pic, which makes sense I mean a lot of the time certain parts of the brick are more pure.
That's great but I'm 420@69 😁
Can't choose which one I want as starter.
All of them look amazing 😍.
I want all of them.

My own thinking is that there seem to be two broad categories of men who transition: those who are feminine in affect, temperament, interests, behaviours, etc., and those who fixate on some kind of male-typical feminine aesthetic ideal that is predicated on some kind of foundational self-hatred, where dysphoria is understood to mean loathing, hatred, negativity, etc., to the nth degree and only to the nth degree.
A low view of self is assumed.
Yee, I wasn't trying to contradict you, I completely agree with you there.
Big oof, tbh
Trudy would adopt the accent rather quickly, I’d imagine.
Would be tougher to convince Pete to learn the two-step.
\*Looking at the date\* Waiiiit a minute...
Heritage could be swapped out for Blasphemer which is way easier to get (I just would recommend you get Autoloading so you can wipe blockers and swap without spending ages reloading).
With Leviathan, preferably have the catalyst and stack arrow scavenger and finders (in case you are wondering, *yes* arrow finder works with Heavy Levaithan's Breath ammo despite specifying Primary ammo), and I'd say have shotgun scavenger at least as well.
 - In step 6 of the degassing section you forgot to write that it is important to close the line valve before turning off the pump, otherwise you can pull your pump oil into the degassing chamber.
This can also be done when the desired vacuum of 29inHG is reached, you don't need to let the pump run the whole degassing duration
\- The pie being poisonned makes sense: the poison used gives the illusion of the target dying as they choke on something.
One doesn't choke an wine.
Aren't in your world especially at that time Serbs who took islam called "poturice" aka Bosniaks?
This will be a contentious thing because there are folks who stand firm that none of this stuff is a choice and you are what you are and can’t change any of it; I think that stance likely comes from a need to self-identify and socially express.
Good points!
I think I'm just over the kids-in-adult-situations thing that exploded after Stranger Things and It.
Totally agree that Jia and Kong's relationship using ASL was really interesting; I just questioned why she had to be *that* young.
It’s not for ease of organization!
It was just to get some cool pics for my blog and book insta!
It goes back to normal organization once I get enough good pictures.
If you check out my book insta you can see that I do know how to properly organize!

I live in Northern Europe and have only had packages being held in customs for extra import tax.
They never asked for any animal testing anything.
So weird.
(But I do currently have a package from reliablerx being held in customs.
And I hope it goes though :_:)
So you’re telling me 911k people sold their shares?

Hong Kong laws are very relaxed, it is actually a location in which we are opening a warehouse.
We have never had a seizure to Hong Kong and so I believe any of the typical popular sources such as Sciencebio & Chemyo would be suitable for you.
We are talking about luxury brand.
Plus, those two are not made with '4doorcoupe' in mind.
Lexus cant even sell enough of every gen GS, why should they be bothered to enter this segment?
They should focus more to stay relevant in luxury market such as fix their incar tech and luxury touches.
Just look at Genesis
Like is nhl the only game you play that you think ddoss doesn’t exist?
I disagree.
Some people do this but shit people will do that with anything.
Also twitter is shit and not representative of all trans women or all trans people.
I recommend better curating your feed or yeeting twitter because this anger is what they profit off of they don't give a fuck if they incite murders or rip communities apart by showcasing shit Lords and trolls that's their bread and butter
Party is fair enough honestly.
If you find someone out and about and you're chatting, you can invite each other to a party and immediately talk to each other.
I'd rather not hear screeching child voices every time I come into town.
Gta 5 online should be a good indication of why public voice chat is a bad idea.
The Barrens chat in WoW was bad enough.
I don't need that in voice form 😂.
At first I was kinda saddened by no proximity chat, but it made more sense the more I thought about it.
I am not crazy!
I know he forged those mail-in ballots.
I knew I had Michigan.
As if I could ever make such a mistake.
I just - I just couldn't prove it.
He covered his tracks, he got those idiots counting votes to lie for him.
You think this is something?
You think this is bad?
This chicanery?
He's done worse.
His son!
Are you telling me that the Ukrainian government just happens to be pressured like that?
HE orchestrated it!
Sleepy Joe!
He TRAFFICKED CHILDREN!
And I saved him!
And I shouldn't have.
I challenged him to a debate!
What was I THINKING?
He'll never change.
He'll NEVER change!
Ever since he was vice president, ALWAYS the same!
Couldn't keep child porn out of his hard drives!
But not our Joe!
Couldn't be precious Joe!
Cheating them blind!
And HE gets to be the president?
What a sick joke!
I should've stopped him when I had the chance!
And you, you have to stop him-
I'm 255 over 6 ft and do .180 wife's 120 and tiny she does .160 or less.
But if we take say 4 week break then I'm around .150 her .125.
It's nothing compared to a regular user.
Actually got made fun of in another reddit group because doses were so small lol.
Now we make capsules to swallow.
As far as smoking or injection I don't have any idea what they dose.
I refuse to shoot up Or smoke it because from what I've heard and researched it's almost a sure way to addiction.
I guess there's an initial rush you get that way that can't be achieved by swallowing.
Again I don't suggest trying it because everyone is different and me personally have control over my cravings.
I was an alcoholic for years and quick cold turkey.
I use cannabis and edibles for my ptsd but when I want too I just go from daily use to nothing for months.
Let me guess, “do your own research” is watching a nutjob spew conspiracies on YouTube?
Articles from Alex Jones and Fox News?
A friend of a friend of a friend of someone they kinda know said such and such?
I'm from Upstate NY and I noticed Verizon has turned off n5 in most places it was active, and most sites it never actually had even been activated yet, just a bunch of fake 5G logos everywhere.
Do you think they're fine tuning it or just leaving it off until better times with C-band?
I’m only upvoting for the greatest interpretation of the Joker RIP Heath Ledger

There may not be that many Jedi anymore, but if Kenobi meets one during his series, I hope it's a Padawan/Knight with some PTSD (Marvel started the trend with including/forcing topics like these in their shows, Star Wars will surely follow suit).
I get that Ahsoka and Kenobi may have some type of bond but there's got to be more than the same twelve people in the Star Wars galaxy, right?

Does anybody have any tips or brand / model suggestions for a keyboard **with well-attached keycaps**?
I have a Corsair K65 and I like it for the most part, *but*, the cross-style keycaps seems to be very prone to popping off, especially when hitting them hard and off-center (e.g., while in a multiplayer game and spamming button presses because you're in a tense situation and it's *exactly the worst possible time* for WADS to pop off ***argh***!)
I've also occasionally had the piece on the keycap break; it's pretty thin and not reinforced well.
Would you say it's no Zaku, boy?
It's not just a strong one, it's a permanent, non-gimmicky strength dragon.
If you missed Fatty your second best choice was either Andromeda if your HP can tank that low on demand or Ramiel/Marshiten.
Granted, Cat, Shinobi, and Arsene are absolutely stupid good skill dragons, the problem is that in Berserk phase you need Strength, not Skills.
Compare that to the other elements that have had some beefy Strength dragons since around or long before their respective Legend Agito fights showed up.
The writing system the Mayans used for Classical Mayan is what's been reconstructed.
It was only in the last forty years that scholars have been able to read and understand it, but the speakers of Mayan languages have just been using Latin-based writing systems this whole time instead.
TBH I think I do.
As awful as it is, there are a lot of things about it I find appealing
I love the old man fucking out of the cameras view dude knew someone had to recorded it 😂
Unless you are n1 (like secret), it becomes a disadvantage to have the same squad for such a long time.
Every1 knows who Liquid is and how they play.
No1 really knew TP for example.
Getting top 6 time after time and even managing to win a big tourny after so many years is impressive to me (not as big as a major but still).
That shit's creepy.
The way she asked you to prostitute yourself is wildly inappropriate.
I would've assumed that she was just into you and being weird about it, but her misgendering you made it evident she has a weird trans fetish.
You had every right to call her out.

Good thing your face showed up to add comedic value 👺
I relate.
This is something you can start with.
Working slowly on mindfulness, on _allowing_ and giving *safe* space to it all to come up.
A journal or a good relatable friend really helps.
Becoming more of distracting patterns that likely try to block out something important.
Keep running away from something and it will become scarier than it is.
Progress slow, one thing at a time.
Look up some affirmations to affirm that how you feel is ok or that it's safe to feel that way etc.
Learn some self-care/soothing skills to help you manage bad feelings.
Dealing with negative feelings can make you feel pretty drained afterwards, so take it easy with the inner work.
These things need time.

Meh still going to pick the players.
Woakes pulled out last year pretty late and he’s still got retained by DC.
Fair enough.
When you zoom out of the M2M Micro-level the perspective changes.
I agree with you though, some months after a large purchase my credit will go down a few points abs bounce back the next month.
He has nothing to do with the Hulk.
He is a Skrull/Kree.
Victor has played 16 playoff games for a total of three 1st round exits.
Lebron has played 260 playoff games.
LBJ shoots 10% higher from 2pt and also has 3-4 more assists and rebounds a game.
Avery Bradley has better stats from 3pt and FT than Oladipo and Lebron.
ngl, it looks modern and fresh.
like it!
Thanks  🙈 😘

My ONE thing that I am confused about gacha kids, why in the living fuck do they spell dont with a capital D even though ITS THE SECOND FUCKING WORD!?
Like kids you dont spell things like this "I Don't think I did", like you LITERALLY NEED TO JUST DO THIS!
"I don't think I did" LIKE BRUH!
Looks like I’m set for lunch as well 😋
I'm curious about this too!
I used to do checkered-board doodles on the margins of my notebooks during high school too, with my normal black or blue pen.
Nowadays I'll work on my bullet journal spreads, and I wonder if the dot-grid pattern on the pages makes it enjoyable for me.

Fees are lower than Etherem due to the face theres less traffic on the chain.
This lil guy was headed for the bin.
I was hoping to save it.
I cut off the stems, and repotted as it was originally packed in some kind of water retaining medium.
A day later I see it’s lost a leaf.
Have I condemned it further?
I was pregnant and they kicked and de-pregnanted me.

Rousseau was at his best as a pass rusher when working against interior linemen so in theory I like him a lot as a developmental DE if we can give him a redshirt year to bulk up to 285 or so.
Wouldn't want him as an OLB/EDGE though.

So limit it to fleet vehicles?
What about novated leases, should they be included as well?
Plenty of senior public servants use those commonly to buy their cars with a tax write off already.
Just seems like a bit of a trickle down economics approach if it’s subsidising cars for the wealthy in the hope that the used market prices will shrink for the poor, doesn’t it?
I moved to the series x from ps4.
Tried the ps4 version again today (I have way more tanks on ps4) and it's simply unplayable due to shockingly low fps.
I'm not sure if this is due to 6.0 or if it was always this bad but since playing on the XSX I can't go back :(
That makes complete sense, especially for the papa bear that is SLG4.
You always go with undergrad you know that

It’s actually the tightest part of your playing.
Which is super cool.
Work on keeping a consistent subdivision on the snare parts.
couldn’t tell what beat you were trying to play on with the hi hat foot.
The fill is in 16th notes, the ride is in 8ths, you kinda got the rhythms mixed up in your notation.

I've been using that for my Mi Band 4 and 5 and it's great that I can choose a smaller font for notifications.
I pretty much never need to scroll for additional text, and I'm far less concerned about someone being able to gleam any sensitive text.
Mi Fit sucks, and sends so much telemetry.

Your choice of inverts for a sealed environment would have to be choice selections though to survive in a sealed environment of such a nature without shortening their longevity.

Then, do a real quick e-mail to her.
Be very clear that the relationship is over.
You don't want her harassing you and stalking you anymore.

If she doesn't stop, you will have to escalate this to the authority and filing a restraining order.

Undervalued compared to other sporting goods joints.
They sell guns and ammo.
Reopening means kids are getting their sports gear that they didn’t buy last year.
Same with professional sports jerseys.
Also they murdered earnings in Q4.
Lots of room for e-commerce growth.
Plus they’re heavily shorted if you give a fuck about that.

This subreddit isn't a place to talk about Antinatalism, it's an hangout place for Antinatalists, and since a lot of Antinatalists are Nihilists, it's not strange to see a lot of negative discussion.

Can I ask, where is gcam from?
For context I haven't done any kind of sport since I graduated from school ~3 Years ago.
During covid I got quite uncomfortable with my body and wanted to loose some weight for the summer.
Though I am not severely overweight or anything I weigh 69 kg (152.1 lb I think) and am 175 cm (5'9 I hope I converted them right) tall.
Companies happier -> more companies participate in C4T, making the platform actually useful -> UMD can advertise and brag about placement of umd students at companies, % of graduates who get hired out of graduation, etc.
We wroted down our info separately, each of us using different system, and on the end of our journey we had two diaries full of stuff to compare and fill out the blank spaces if one of us forgot anything :)
I guess we have different ways to look at them, then.
Which is fine, don't get me wrong, I get your point.
I'd just add that I'm glad that we only have another season, I feel like the shoe is still good, but on rewatching everything I do see a tendency to get more and more absurd and fast paced that cpuld spoil the show going forward

what is the 4506T, tax transcripts right?
the real ones right, no drafts here..  because for ppp loans I submitted only drafts of 2019 -2010 taxes.
so, if they see my real low income, they will denied me or what..  and yes, in ppp i got more funds for my loan becuase I put more money, reply.
any conflicts here?

Guarantee if he has an IG or TikTok though because of his aesthetic, the person pictured does have a following and he’s not going to be wanting to marry some girl he only met virtually.
Anyway, she got an internship in Norway RIGHT before the pandemic and they moved there temporarily, and part of their reasoning was that they could travel on the weekends and take in Europe.
Then Covid happened.
So they are kind of stuck, can't come back to the US even to visit because they wouldn't be able to go back to Norway (and their cat would be trapped due to quarantine rules) and her internship is basically on paid hold while they are stuck unable to travel.

The strings went missing 10 years ago when I got it in.
I went in and had a scan to make sure it was still there and everything looked fine.
They said I wouldn’t have to worry about it until I got it out.
Well it’s time to get it out and the doc ordered the ultrasound to check the position before he went in.
That’s when we found it wasn’t there and he assumed I expelled it unknowingly but ordered an X-ray just in case.
I haven’t had any symptoms at all which I guess is even more rare!
They originally awarded me at 90% in the beginning (70% schizo and 50% for sleep apnea) and I almost went bankrupt in my appeal process only for them to screw me over at the last minute and give me 100% but none of the 40k they owed me in back pay.
You can also apply to SSDI for a little more, but focus on the 100% for now.
Good luck

My previous car I had (2004 Saturn ion).
I love that car.
But the emergency brake was a little dicey.
It was a manual so to put it in ‘park’ I used the e brake.
I don’t usually turn my car off when I’m delivering groceries.
I could also leave the keys in that car, door wide open, and it be out of sight and know no one would steal it.
So many people don’t know how to drive manuals anymore.
Lol anyway.
I had to be careful with parking on inclines.
The e brake locked up the back tires.
Well one of them stopped working.
So at the end it locked up one tire.
My first winter doing shipt, I was unloading the groceries and my car literally started sliding down the driveway.
Luckily I was right there and hopped in and stopped it.
But after that whenever I parked even on a slight incline I looked down to see if my car started sliding, what if any damage would it do.
But she officially died last spring.
So now I have a 2009 g37x.

This post we are talking under is about Gravity Rush and the fact that SIE Japan had only 1 PS4 exclusive with a fanbase is a major testament to why they were shut down.

Why do you need a hand crafted titanium exhaust lady.

I know it's silly, but I never expected hard mode to be HARD.
Been playing hard mode for years and regularly kicked the game's ass.
But now.... the faster enemy tears, tinted rocks are a myth, red chests just have troll bombs, it's absolutely brutal in terms of survivability, on top of learning so many new enemy patterns.
I think I'm going to play normal mode, at least until I can survive frikkin' glowy flies that shoot fire.

I feel that meal-delivery business are a better area to look at, as it should reduce food waste if you get only the ingredients you need.
The issue there is the amount of single-use plastic that individual items can be wrapped in.
Most infiltrators don’t lose out on tac cloak recharge if you quickly shoot after activating the ability.
Using tac cloak and a power (ie: snap freeze) into a shot in quick succession helps you get the most out of your tac cloak bonuses.
As a result you can slap medium weight or heavy weapons on infiltrators and still get a 3ish second recharge.
Yeah same here.

Not only is serotonin syndrome not really a risk with non-MAOI antidepressants, tianeptine barely has any serotonin activity, it's primarily an atypical opioid.

However, Cleveland does play too tall for the guard position and loses the leverage battle for the most part.
He is really high-hipped, that chest flips forward and eyes drop a lot, when initiating first contact, which can create some balance issues and tend to have him slip off blocks.
Because of his build, he is certainly a bit of a waist-bender and his hands get pretty wide in protection, not necessarily landing forceful strikes routinely, while the ability to redirect literally is average at best.
due in part to how much he limits himself at the hip level.
And let’s not forget, that he only has one full year as starter, because of past academic issues and a broken fibula in 2018.
Would he?

For example, think of how many federal contracts were put on hold or were cancelled entirely by Covid.
All those aren't coming back quick, and neither will the tax funds generated by then for state and local governments.
Luckily in Maryland, the fed will eventually start pumping again and the state will be ok. Other states I see having issues.

Isn’t it also possible to lose lane because the other jungler camped while your jungler affected other parts of the map?
Not necessarily a bad thing, as that’s pressure elsewhere on the map, but I feel it’s possible to lose lane even if you out match your opponent and are on the top of your game.
Still not your junglers “fault”, just their decision to not match the pressure in your lane.

Our family has several different types of income.
We have w-2, self-employed, and investment property income.
The way we have figured it is that we pay tithing on income that we receive before we deduct anything that would be tax deductible, like our mortgage payments or phone bills or things like that.
As you say, we'd be paying those things any way.
If it lowers our tax bill so that we get a tax refund, we don't pay tithing on that money.
Interesting, i just came across it on Etsy somewhere during my browsing...can't remember the seller.

China has been the best performing region for all TIs except TI3.
They always had a team placing in the top 3 consistently and sometimes multiple teams too.
Not to mention the majors and other international tournaments they have won.
If any region deserves more slots, it is China.

It depends on your area and your cashier i suppose.
I live in an area where some municipalities have instituted plastic bans or charging for bags so everybody gets used to keeping reusables on them.
If your cashier is also the type to care about the environment then I can see trying to limit how many bags go out but if you specifically asked for one I think you should have gotten one.
Either that or keep a small reusable on you.

people are gonna find politics in everything.
i could argue that this poll itself is political, because i really do think it sounds like a conservative bias to get called out for sounding like an ignorant dumbass and then suddenly there's a vote to ban political discussion.
i think that's a little knee-jerk, though.
i also think it's a lot of work, since it feels like 90% of reddit posts are relatively partisan when you're talking about subs that are about information, disinformation, and disagreeable behaviors.
if you're theoretically willing to put in the work to 'ban politics,' why not put that effort toward making mod a job that moderates, and enforcing some kinda process to make sure posts toe the line of 'confident' + ' incorrect'?

I would usually time my departure from my house/work to get to the train when it was scheduled and it's almost always on time.
Sometimes there were issues (usually due to their aging rail car fleet) and there would be delays, but they follow their schedule closely when there are no problems.
The excuses that you can’t train at home and can’t go do anything because of Covid is BS.
I have been setting my alarm to go off every 20 min and when it does sound, I do 10 push ups, squats, or sit ups.

Tbh at this point I never understand how people can even refer to the early draft not including certain characters as anything to give a shit about.
Characters like Rem, Ram or Wilhelm wern't in the first drafts and look at how much focus all of them have gotten just until now?
All 3 have had several big character arcs in the story up until now and taken up major parts of all arcs since arc 2.
My *favourite* is Susebron but we never really got a chance to see him *ruling* and, alas, Elkohar was working towards being a good one but wasn't there yet.

So in the end, I gotta go with Iodon.
In response to the idea that admission is a "black box", of course it is.
There are only x spots available and a ton of student demand, so they can only take the top n%.

Zinc upper intake is 40mg per day unless under doctors advice.
You can totally OD on it, but I'm really surprised that you haven't noticed some side effects like getting extremely nauseous since you're taking so much, most side effects are noticed when people take more than 30 a day which is why most zinc brands sell it at 20-22 and extra strength at 30mg.
You're on the right path to chat with your doctor, but for sure, check upper limits before taking even over the counter supplements.
But there's more you can do with it if you use the phone after killing one of the targets, you can move the malestrom to the other sides of the map to meet targets.

Treb could be more inaccurate, so it would be more unlikely to snipe units, it would only reliably hit something when the enemy is marching in formation.
Or lower the splash radius of flaming shots, fire rate is fine IMO, don’t feel like waiting 20 minutes at sieges to wait for their ammo to run out and begin the assault.
I read the entire Manga, solely because of Anime, specially because episode 19 blew my mind.. it was spectacular.. but is the storyline interesting.. yup...
But is it comparable to one piece.. absolutely no.. it has a very simple storyline and sorry to state, inspite of having good characters, little has been done.. most of the characters justice was done only in the last arc... And Nezuku was so underused that it broke my heart, specially after the brilliant development in the first half.
That's OK I've never heard of covid passing from someone chewing on an ear.
Is there a vegetarian mean for MREs or no?
It is the job of logistics managers to sync supply with demand, which has not happened here.
It was always clear that the per capita take rate in vax-suspicious red counties would be well lower than the take rate in more pro-vaccine, more urban blue counties.

Better than Skyrim.
Thats a great Idea, what I would love to read are stories from the perspective from something other than the bobs, the world that is beeing created in this universe is almost always shown through the eyes of a bob, I'd like to know how some random humans, deltan, pav etc.
perceives the stuff happening in the bobiverse
🎄🐢 Was funny but also...
Imagine today a talented goon like McDavid gets cold clocked in the jaw from behind, falls to the ice and 'turtles' against the incoming blows *and then almost all of hockey fandom was like fuck that guy what a turtlin pussy bitch*.
The nineties was a wild time.
One time a star player threatened Bettman *and* his family over a lockout.
Which, like, fair enough but save it for after the TV interview!
You have to go out of your way to be anti-racist, and the white men who go out of their way to be anti-racist are noticeable.
They exist, and many of them are good friends of mine, and you can tell who they are because they don't get super triggered when race comes up as a topic.
Ivern doesn't want to fight
Fire burns, water is wet, aapl is a buy.
Dude I'm not even the one saying this; literally all I'm doing is relaying what *actual indigenous people* have told me.
Here, I'll literally just copy-paste something an indigenous friend said in response to someone saying all killing of animals is wrong:
I just bought this PS3.
Feeling very 🤡 right now.
All the titles I wanted physical copies of are now selling for $200 and up after the news broke out.
The demon prince of wisdom and science.
He's my dude.
Lol, you have no idea what a Tankie actually is, huh?

uh XxPussyDestroyer69xX this bra isn't mine
TBH assassins creed shouldn’t be in europe for its next entry.
The last 2 were in europe and most of the games so far have been in europe.
Imo the next game should be set in asia
Edge of the Outcasts Redemple Temple.
I’m 5’10” and 145lbs.
I have the large.
It is a little bit big on me.
I think the L will be too small for you at 6’ 190lbs.
The dungeon 1 and dungeon 2 version stories are tied together, so do the first one and then the second one to get the whole story.
Otherwise the rest of the dungeons stay completely independent of each other storywise, so you can just go random.
He has never been there but knows it all🤣🤣
Omg you got to see my old art style HKALSDHFALKHF Thanks!!
I'm really proud to have reached this point honestly and it's really sweet to hear that ❤

Looking for help with Wandering Asshole 550.
I can't seem to get past 80% in FFI, FFII, FFV.
I have 80+ HC decks.

Help appreciated.
Most appreciated kind redditor
Much appreciated!
So if we DID want to camp in VIP, we could theoretically buy a car camping pass and simply-- not-- have a car?
Probably hurts for more people like kidney stones & mayne the other person is being sarcastic but maybe not.
Its like some people who actually enjoy tattoos & say it feels good, maybe it depends on the person ( ^^^maybe its maybelline)
you might call it.. a greydiant!
there is a lot of sand abound.
but will be scarce shortly.
buy now.
Uhhhhh solves the pet overpopulation problem I guess.
The plant seems to be divided between 2 big bulbs, with the biggest one curling and yellow tips, and the smaller one (with the crooked leaves from transport) seeming fine somehow.
It also has a baby leaf coming out but it's taking aaaaageeeeees.
Lmao rip
Not familiar with the schools here but don’t listen to the people in this thread saying “it doesn’t matter where you go to undergrad”.
Where you go to undergrad is arguably the most important thing for increasing your odds of success in IB recruiting.
The guy saying IBs look for masters and PhDs (lol) is also wrong
Pay your artists Spirtomb.
like, I kinda used to read the softer shit like dojins on deviantart but I never got to see the actual sex cuz patreon
They changed the rank system, there is no MP tuning now.
MAX PRO is the best you can get, as on every rank the dominant cars are the MAX PRO, they get a slightly advantage(compare stock to MAX PRO at the same rank, you'll see it).
And well, if you dont upgrade fully, it still doesnt matter.
You can try not upgrading the handling, but that saves only 5 rank points.
Not like its gonna change your opponents.
Could try going for full acceleration upgrade, like 5505 0055.
Everyone is equal in terms of max speed rn, what matters is the car's base stats - acceleration, nitro duration, handling.
What matters is the car you use.
I recommend getting Pininfarina to MAX PRO, as that car is able to destroy everyone else at that rank.
Its funny, basically you want the class kings, because they dominate the rank.
Atom, Donker, Pininfarina, Audi SE, Acura, Ford GT, Beast X, Centenario, Jesko.
Especially the shotguns because they lack a serious oomf to them
I'm in on 50 JAN 2023 LEAPS of PLTR @ $25 strike.
Okay so for the jade set, you want jade hat, spooky robe, dragoon boots, an outgoing wand, morganthe athame, uber amulet, stone of the other side, probably a proof, double outgoing, mend unicorn pet with brace defy, the outgoing mount, and any deck with a triangle socket
Joker bair won't have Arsene attached to it the majority of the time, and even then it's hardly infallible.
I've shared the specifics on GnW nair in response to the comment you replied to.
I was about to shift completely over to guards, but my economy tanked after my own Russo-Japanese War.
I was on the verge of bankruptcy, but limiting Guards to just 2 per stack helped.
At the moment, I'm on par with the other great powers, except the UK in Army Tech, so mostly Infantry hasn't hurt too much.
Yeah, I found great difficulty with EE on EX because they already "build in" the 2 or 3 months of EE into the "on record until" date.
The date given is generally 6y 10m from DoFD, making EE requests moot most the time since they already or giving you 2 or 3 months with that date listed, meaning you could, at best, request it the month of the "on record until" date (since they generally do not age it off til mid to end of that month) or the month prior.
hello PR ni VP Leni, this is your golden opportunity.
you could work something out of this, i think?

Yeah, don’t hold on Coinbase (or any exchange for that matter).
You own nothing but an IOU at that point, and if Coinbase decides to lock your account for a random reason (happens all the time), disappear, disable selling/buying, disable withdraws, etc etc etc, you’re screwed and there’s not one thing you can do about it because you don’t control the private key.
They're called "threenagers" for a reason.
Also: Zidane is on CAM because CAM to CM was extinct on PS5 today for some reason lol can’t find one
If the devs were smart this would have been a 0-mana non-discoverable spell, that doesn't take up a deck card slot and only has the text: "**If this is iN BOTH players' decks, turns are only 15 seconds lost.
Remove this at the start of game.
Is Triceratops
I think mr.P is countered by mortis.
Wishing you the best of luck.
Having realised how terrible our timing often was during our first round of TTC, I've just ordered the premom OPKs to hopefully speed things up a bit this time around, so your post gives me hope we'll get pregnant much quicker this time!
I was a kiss manga refugee and have finally gotten comfortable here.
Dont want to jinx it but I really want mangadex to come back
Non-tech company?
Haven't you heard?
Every company where you can at least provides online ordering and delivery is now a tech company.
Dominos, Pizza hut, Chipotle are also tech companies that use AI to deliver the best customer service :-)
I hold a small bag as I am sure they will pump.. sometime 😀
This is great success mate!
Don’t listen to the people that just want the best tips and then downvote because it’s the same tips again.
I have been uploading videos for 2 months now (weekly) and I currently have 8 subscribers.
Did your upload schedule make any difference?
For example do you see lots of success in uploading daily/weekly/monthly and so on?
Or learn to counter grenade spam.
Spamming all of your grenades at a single player is a smoothbrain low skill level play.
Learn to punish bad players who do it.
NICE JOB BRO.
that boss took me days holy fuck
You’ve got this!
Also the imagery of pacis sprinkled around the baby made me smile 😊
yes, a lot of people vote against the opposite party rather than for their own.
people need to be more involved in primaries in the US so we aren't stuck with shitty choice vs shittier choice.
Monke waiting for big green KongDong^TM to start ReEeEeEeEeEeE1!!1!
Looking at some positives for today, I like the bullpen so far, and we seem to have remembered how to hit so I'll just chalk up today to opening day jitters.
Bro wtf the whole point of the movie is about how the members of the League are able to overcome their trauma by uniting and working together.
The literal tag-line of the movie was #UsUnited.
A 7x7 grid for boomerville considering they just wanted to play bingo in peace maybe?
Em: "He stole our badminton set, and will not give it back and he HiT mE!"

3Ms underrated
Thank you for the ideas!
I like the pantsuit one the most, since I'm usually in jeans/ pants / shorts :D
What the 🦆
I am not massaging at all.
I wore the compression bandeau to push the implants down for the first month.
Then at my one month post op appt my surgeon said I didn't need to wear it anymore because gravity would settle them over time.
I also got dual plane implants and not completely submuscular, so they never had the REALLY high pec implant look, but they were definitely higher up and making my nipples look weird and low.
Now I'm just being patient, I am worried that a massage could make them drop TOO much and I certainly don't want low hanging boobs!
Did your doctor tell you to massage?
I want to know what mito-chlorians Kenobi was smoking before the fight then.
There was a time there when drive capacity was getting about 10x larger every ~5ish years.
It has slowed in the last decade but still going.
Other good entry points are also Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza: Like A Dragon.
Kiwami is the beginning of the Yakuza franchise in terms of chronological order, however, it may be hard to appreciate the legacy of main stay characters (hence the purpose of 0's release)
Hector wouldn't allow Roy to be with Lilina.
Yeah, I agree and wasn't implying that her company was stopping her from dancing.
If anything, I've only seen her be self-deprecating about her dance skills, so I was more wondering if anybody had seen any interviews where she talked about wanting to dance, or practicing more so she could dance, etc.
that gave insight on her sudden inclusion of more dancing and choreo in her MV's and promotions.
About 20 minutes later a large number of cop cars arrive and start searching rooms on the upper floors, I shared a room with several other staff and there were a bunch of drugs in there so everyone was scared shitless.
I immediately go to the lobby and hand myself in to prevent a search, the cops only had a few questions before dropping the issue but they told me I was in deep shit with my employer.
So busy wondering if they could, but never really thinking about if they should😂 kudos that’s dedication
Her legs wrapping around him only brought him more deeply into her, his constant effort now to ravish her as hard as he could.
It’d make sense if it was like Treya or something but this is Disney so it’s just going to be a new character who is somehow inextricably more powerful great
And if you can't do regular push-ups, start with stair push-ups.
Aww he thinks he’s the center of the world... so little and so sad of a person
Good characters, storylines and humour.
Black Lagoon is funnier, Jormungand has the most bad-ass, world-weary, 11 year old child soldier you'll ever see.
Great shows.
