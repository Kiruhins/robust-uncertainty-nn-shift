If I knew about Alteryx before picking up Python, I probably wouldn't even need Python on my job, tbh.
The only nice part about Python, at this point, is Python is free and can do a little more than Alteryx, since it's a lower-level way of talking to systems.
Since not all clients/companies want to pay for another program, knowing Python is useful for automating tasks when I can't use Alteryx to do it for me.

On Muramasa, not really.
Narita talks about how he likes referencing filler & those can be taken with a grain of salt.
That said, all he says about Muramasa, as far as I can recall, is that it's a hereditary Zanpakuto, so it wouldn't really contradict the plot at all just if there was a Zanpakuto called Muramasa.
We could also reasonably infer that it has the same basic power.
I wouldn't say it means the whole Zanpakuto Rebellion happened, though.
Even if there was some kind of Zanpakuto Rebellion, it could be something that happened in the Soul Society's distant past, rather than the actual events depicted in the filler arc.

Thankfully I figured it out, but I love to walk/jog around now and not use fast travel.
So I would say to just do what you want, go where you want, save often, do your first playthrough unmodded (vanilla) and you are allowed to not go by the lore and join the stormcloaks if you want.
You will definitely make more characters in the future.
Also, you don't have to do everything at once, you can do some bounty jobs for the holds and level up you character before deciding what to do.
Have fun!

What type of exercise, are you calculating the exercise into your calorie allotment, what type of calories are you eating?
All of these can affect what‚Äôs happening.
If you aren‚Äôt calculating the calories from your exercise, you may be eating too little or too much and either of those can prevent weight loss.
Also calculating those calories accurately via a tracking app helps, a lot of people often estimate the amount of calories they are eating and usually you are eating more than you think.
I use the (free) Lose It app to calculate my calories and I have a Garmin Forerunner to track my steps and calories from my workouts.
If you are already doing all of these things, your body may just be acclimating to your new routine.

For those who can go and/or do go straight to industry, I agree with you.
But again, it's a question of age.
When I was making my decision, I was 48 years old, and had spent many years working in pink-collar wage (read barely above minimum) jobs before I even got a bachelor's at 39.
When I was deciding what to do next, these were things I needed to take into consideration.
I had a lot of lost retirement savings time to make up, and I couldn't afford/can't afford to take 4 years off even with a graduate student stipend.
A 2 or 3 year program suited my financial position.
But I'd mentioned that--had I been 25 years younger, the calculations would have been radically different.

You should be able to just keep it up.
One of her talents decreases her cooldown on her E by 0.3 seconds for every normal or charged crit attack, so ideally you would E, then normal attack 2 or 3 times, then E again.
You could repeat that until you have full stacks of the 4 piece, then use your hold E or your Q. Additionally, if you have her 2nd constellation, her hold E is also 4 seconds, so you can just constantly cycle two press E‚Äôs and one hold E (for the Grimheart stacks), while maintaining the 4 piece buff.

My order from McMunn and Yates was like.. 60% crap that I had to return myself, after it was delivered.
No exaggeration.
I can't fucking take it.
I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it.
"Oh that looks kinda like the sarvante mod" it started as.
That's funny, that's a cool reference.
But I kept going, I'd see a ice cream that looked like sarvante, I'd see an animated black and white rainbow that looked like Sarvante, I'd see a shirt that looked like Sarvante.
And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words THAT'S VEY UNHOLY OF YOU ran through my head.
It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an napolitan ice cream.
I can't fucking live like this...
I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't!
And don't get me fucking started on the words!
I'll never hear the word servant again without thinking of Mid Fight masses.
Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than "Ruv."
I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is "reminds me of ruv" and laugh like a fucking insane person.

The phrase "napolitan" is ruined.

As an Armed Guard in the US, I carried a HK45.
I also owned an AR-15 rifle.
The rifle was unwieldy in confined spaces, and depending on the circumstances less lethal than the handgun.
There's a reason that the US has 364 rifle deaths in 2019, but had 600 deaths from physical combat and 1,476 knife deaths.
Weapons that look like weapons of war (assault-style weapons) are not a significant threat, in the US, or in Canada.

My take would be TOK-ish, wherein choosing a non-sticker attack would allow you to do only 1 per turn, causing the need to use stickers.

In regards to genetic communities I have a hunch that groups of people who migrated to Western Canada might be one of the upcoming updates to this portion of AncestryDNA.
I see this mainly because there are already quite a few Western Canadians who have taken AncestryDNA, and it is one of the few regions in North America that doesn't have really that much coverage in respect to genetic communities (Pretty much just Southern Albertan Mormons and Canadian Icelanders currently).
Some of things I would like to see come out of that would include: M√©tis settler groups, Ukrainian and/or Russian communities, French and/or Belgian communities (I have lots of ancestry from Lorraine & Haute Marne, so I'd be interested to see this), refined Germans from Russia communities (I'm part Crimean German, so something just for that part of my background would be nice), and refined British communities (If Ancestry is capable of identifying 94 genetic communities in Ireland, Scotland and England can easily get more detailed communities).

I know there is no confirmation of it or anything but from someone who has played this game all too much, I feel like skill based or at least ridiculous matchmaking is in this game now.
This ruins the feel of every game for me and I‚Äôm tired of the way companies keep doing this to pander to the lowest common denominator (obviously for money ik they ain‚Äôt dumb) and inadvertently hoe everyone else out who is a long-standing member of the community.

I feel like I‚Äôm not playing the best either this season but there is no shot I got from a 58-10 season with 2 Ls being lag outs, to 8-7 this season and even sweatier games in tto than usual.
I got on 2 days ago after class and fucking played Dichotomy (comp player from last year) and Isaac back to back games.
This shit is mentally draining.
I don‚Äôt wanna roll over people every game but with a structure of having to play 50+ games a season for anything worth while of a reward and having 75% of them be comp games is ridiculous.
I feel like I‚Äôve been bitching a lot lately about this game here and don‚Äôt want to come off negative, but I just love 2k and the way they, or other game companies operate, is just a depressing fuck you to us as players more often than not.
I got other shit going on aside from this game between finishing up college, social life and all that but I like to come back to gaming to either have a good time with friends and enjoy myself.
Skills based ruins everything in that regard and this is the least fun I‚Äôve had in a season on this game, and I even quit for the entire Dwayne Wade reward season to take a break.
I am probably not smarter but I am studying biology in University.
A plant has only 3 organs: leaf, root and stem.
Everything you find on a plant is a modified  organ.

Argh, I'm so gutted right now.
The game is far buggier and performs worse since I installed this new patch.
Watching this clip and reading the comments on this sub are heartbreaking for me right now because it seems nobody else is really having issues and is excited about how much this has improved things whereas it has had the polar opposite effect for me.
So many broken and glitchy animations, popping NPCs and the biggest culprit is lip synching being all over the place.
Characters' lips don't move more often than they do while talking to me.
I guess this is karma for me having hardly any issues with the game in its last few versions.

Racism exists.
A component of racism is cultural suprememacy: the idea that the culture of racial and ethnic minorities is inferior to that of white people.
Rap (more accurately called hip-hop‚Äìrap is a technique, not a genre) is part of black culture, so it is likewise seen as inferior.

If you didn't react to the first one its possible that you are reacting to the tapes you bought.
You can hold the sensor down with all sorts of things.
Some people use regular bandaids, some use kinesio tape (my personal favorite).

I purchased hyperbiotics PRO Dental's probiotics a few days ago because I heard it could freshen my breath (still waiting for it to deliver).
They make for odd bedfellows, the Chinese refer to them as Baizou, white left & they despise them more than hawkish Western conservatives, but as Stalin said they make for useful idiots in a global power struggle
3rd edition is basically a cleaner playing version of 2nd and it's been out for over a year now.
There is no longer a 1" bounceback if you fail to route a unit which speeds the game up a bit and prevents some of the wonkeyness that would happen  becuase of that.
There weren't any huge changes to the various armies though The Brotherhood got split into 2 sub factions with one allied to Basilea and the other to the Forces of Nature.
It's easier to believe someone planted 54 trees 8 years ago, over them buying 54 Bitcoin and still hodling them today

Bro why would I think I‚Äôm smart for that?
Just hope you‚Äôre okay man.
Don‚Äôt spend your time on the internet arguing over opinions and personal beliefs.
A lot of things you said were very hypocritical and instead of arguing we can unite and make this world a better place and not by arguing back and forth.
But besides that did you say ‚Äúget fucked‚Äù??
Lmao I recommend you never say that corny shit again for your own sake.
I‚Äôll leave it at that.
Play devils advocate.
Dont tunnel vision on only your beliefs because there are so many others out there.
Nice I still feel the same for Neith.

Literally the comments on this post are so edgy and weird.
the song is very upfront about what she had to deal with so why would the music video not be similar ??
Tastes like chicken.
And I doubly agree on the ethical intrigue.
Both aspects prove to me that the writing is still there.
It's simply the execution that hasn't been up to par, at least yet.
Maybe the budget was reserved for the latter half.

I've tried putting my pilots to explore... they're all idiots.
Even my 4 star pilots will fly directly into an asteroid, or in circles.
I've even had a couple pilots pathfind to the target I gave them by flying a circle around the galaxy.... when they were already in the system the target was in lol.
Your honor, I present evidence #42069 into the official record on why cats are assholes.

Did you read the DD it all connects.
He wasn‚Äôt making wild conspiracy theories he was just connecting the facts with graphs and actual charts to represent the numbers.

I won‚Äôt give financial advice and I wouldn‚Äôt even take my own financial advice but if the market was crashing Great Depression style your best bet ‚Äúhypothetically‚Äù would be to buy precious metals such as silver and gold.

There's a lot more to a good job than money.
They ask that because they want someone who'll be into their work and fit in with the place well.
If you go in there saying "uhhh idk money duhh" you sound like a teenager with a negative attitude who doesn't give a shit about the job and will only do the bare minimum to not get fired.
They're sorting out the kind of people who are there for the paycheck and the kind of people who are there because they love their work and take pride in it.
I haven‚Äôt thought of it like that, tbh this will be my first ever portfolio
He is a good person then.
Other female subreddit or social medias could be like tik tok or something are more female dominated so they more likely discuss their issues etc.
Would you mine explaining further the transferring gold from rs3 to osrs?

I just hope he produces more thought-provoking conversations about music, money, media, science, etc.
Such a shambles.
I know HCWs who couldn‚Äôt even book in for an appt with a GP to get vaccinated.
The hospital they work at privately has had to step in and assign them  vaccines.
Most of the GP clinics are a mess because they don‚Äôt even know when they are getting the vaccine delivered.
I am at an absolute loss as to WHY this isn‚Äôt organised?
Greg Hunt needs to fire the person in charge for distribution and get someone in (maybe someone who already works on vaccine distribution ie.

I think they want to cause the target to psychologically erode as part of a sacrificial ritual.
If they can get the target into the mental health facility, homeless government program, prison, or forced to live in the home of a gangstalking family member (a spiritual and economic prison) they can trap them and continue the ritual to deprive them  of any righteousness, holiness or divine abilities they may have and take it for themselves.
They want to send the target to hell in their place.
it‚Äôs true.

Chances are we‚Äôre going to see a renovated Highmark which is just  affordable enough to quell all but the most ardent anti-stadium crowd.

She makes me sick every time I see her face,I‚Äôve never seen a more hateful evil heartless bitch in my life than what she is,that fact Ethan gave her a platform just shows what his true intentions is throughout all this it was financial and for subs and her it was all personal,like he knows what a bad person she is but ignored all she‚Äôs done to people some stuff that is absolutely disgusting but like Ethan her and his fans choose to ignore it because it‚Äôs all about getting pleasure of seeing other ppl crumble and loose everything so she can gain from it also financially but mainly what it states in this heading as people‚Äôs downfalls,none of this that she‚Äôs done is because she r Ethan cares because they don‚Äôt give a fuck what happened poor Hannah they used that as bait to draw everyone in,like she‚Äôs says little about SA but when she does it‚Äôs always about her and the fact she does this when SHE HERSELF SEXUALLY ABUSED JASON WHILE SLEPT AND LAUGHED ABOUT UT IS FUCKED UP,none of there side talks about Hannah only to defend when they are attacking David,his name was used in every tiktok post Twitter podcast and YouTube NEVER DOMS,they use Hannah‚Äôs trauma for there gain and it‚Äôs disgusting,I can‚Äôt wait for her to turn on Ethan because that‚Äôs what Trisha does best she has no friends for a reason that reason being she‚Äôs a bitter woman that can‚Äôt see anyone do well or be happy for anyone unless she‚Äôs involved,I pray Jason takes her to court he‚Äôs so much on her but doesn‚Äôt air it all over social media for sympathy like she does,CAN WE PLEASE GET HER ASS OFF SOCIAL MEDIA SHE DESERVES ALL THE HATE SHE GETS

WB had next to no haki at Marineford.
He had a heart attack when he tried to use conquerors and had blows on Aokiji and Akainu that observers thought killed them but since he wasn't using haki it didn't do anything.
Wouldn't it make more sense for him to come now that we have mass communication?
Also I meant he could have sacrificed himself as early as Adam and Eve, and then come back as a preecher or something now so everyone would know

Anywho just some musings.
Then you work on identifying maladaptive beliefs that were formed in childhood that are operating under the surface today.
These inform our romantic partner choices, how we behave, feel, etc.
we can create our own self fulfilling prophecies!
Best way honestly is to jump in.
Join a cookgroup and absorb info like a sponge.
If you join one that doesn't suit you that's fine, you can leave and join a different one.
You need to always upgrading and improving.
Without a cookgroup you'll get a lot more noise than good info, but at least with one, the information is consolidated.
So absolutely by creating real jobs you reduce the need for welfare and that's positive and valid.
The issue with a jobs guarantee is that goes beyond creating real jobs and into the realm of makework and yes workfare.
The trick is to look away and talk to the immunizer about baseball or something.
If you get the shot while you're babbling it's a lot easier.
It also hurts even less if you let your arm go dead weight.

I also take buproprion xl.
For me it is less effective than other stimulants, but the desire to abuse the modafinil is almost non-existent for me(I am recovering addict with 17 months clean).
It is somewhat difficult to compare since it is a completely different drug than traditional stimulant.
Modafinil has a complex mechanism of action which is different than other stimulants.

My dad has been married almost 10 years now and although the woman has her share of things about her I don‚Äôt like, they make sense together and there are some similarities to my mother.
I visit them about once a year from LA (as well as other family I have in georgia where he moved).
I Talk to my dad on the phone every now and again.
But at the end of the day I‚Äôm an adult and I live on my own and take care of myself and live on the total other side of the country.
This woman is not my mom, she is not my stepmom, she is my dads wife and I don‚Äôt feel bad about that.
It‚Äôs almost unrealistic to expect otherwise.
There is definitely some times where things pop up where he wants us to do XYZ for her but it‚Äôs not all that often.
If he‚Äôs happy and she treats her well, great, but I have an entire life of my own.
If you live at home with them and do lots of things then that‚Äôs one thing but at 25 it is what it is.
You‚Äôre relationship is with your dad, if one builds with the others than great.
As long as there‚Äôs a shared respect with everyone, amazing.

Patients in the US have to either illegally buy it from other countries and risk losing their meds to customs during the mailing process or they have to fight to get on it with compassionate use through the **FDA** and it can only be filled at one pharmacy in Texas and it isn‚Äôt covered by insurance either way you get it.

Once in the Interplanes, they will be hunted by demonic hordes trying to skin them alive and slave them.

Grey zone lock down is worse than nothing in our "very low risk" district.
Our cases/100k are less than Toronto or Peele has ever been since March 2020.
We currently have less than a dozen active  and no hospitalized cases.
Anti-mask and Anti-vax are hot garbage.
A proactive approach which relies on our best current science and seeks to keep safe activities open is what we truly need.
We require leadership on the provincial level which is sorely lacking.
The real problem is just Vu, lol.
If you do need to take it you'll most likely have him, there's only one other prof teaching 272 I think.

He asks a question and if you give a slightly wrong answer he'll be sarcastic and make fun of what you said lol.
Rumor is he only gives one A per class, and honestly I feel like that's true because I got a C and I thought I did everything more than well (but I wouldn't know becauseee he does not give ANY grade updates!!)

Anyway, so I just noticed that if you get enough star pieces for a character like from event missions or from the Tazuna store, you can just outright buy the character I stead of having to roll for them.
Now that gives me incentive to actually buy star pieces from Tazuna's shop that I don't have yet...

You can definitely skip deadlifts just replace it with something that uses the hinge movement pattern and hits the hams and glutes.

Why are the Francophone countries better off post-colonialism than many other areas that were colonized and exploited for less time?
I would suggest that you look up a Hal Higdon or other half marathon training plan.
The key is to be consistent and slowly build up miles.
Each weekend should have a progressively longer run culminating in 11 or 12 mile run a few weeks before the race.
I train for my half marathons running 3x a week with strength training mixed in.
And full of my cumüòâ
And it would be worth even more if you could build four units the same lot and sell each for $600k.
That would be lower per unit cost, but higher value for the lot.
We can make this a win for people selling, building and buying.

If I go more than a few days without a cigarette, the first few are quite a strong headrush and if I smoke two or three in a row like I usually would, it makes me nauseous and shaky for like half an hour.
Couple days of consecutive smoking and I can put down half a pack in an hour without a problem.
the brothers started the no bummers thing and the fandom has taken it an ran with.
Even if people try to be critical of the brothers outside of Specific fandom spaces it's like when a shark smells blood.
the Fandom finds them and often times harasses them.
and while they rarely if ever directly cite no bummers it can feel like an extreme version of that mantra is behind rabid defense of the brothers.
You are degenerate, noxious and depraved.
I feel debased just for knowing you exist.

I wanted to buy a house with my bf but I have realized we should take a step back and RENT together and test out living- ALONE together before committing to that kind of thing.
Both of is have our own apartments rn though.

There was no Collection Data there.

This is a great example of just how hard it is to regulate system-wide risk.
Each of the PBs had no idea what the other PBs were doing with Archegos, so none of them knew the true extent of Archegos' leverage.
This led them to all extend more leverage than they probably otherwise would have, and also forced them to initiate the margin call because they couldn't be sure that any of the other banks would jump the gun (which is what happened).

The demand for this APU was /  is way way lower than for the 4800H considering the only a little higer price.

There's also been a few older examples like Philly with Saric and Embiid, Denver with Jokic and Mudiay, and Lakers with Kuzma and Lonzo who have had their rookie duos make the all rookie team.
We waste too much time on this... instead we should all get naked in one ginormous orgy

ACNH, and especially this community, makes me happy!!!
However it's totally possible papuans and austtonesian made the journey together.
the generateExcelFile() is returning a buffer.
I'm logging to the console to check that.
Yes, and also because of Golang's small, growable stacks.
Normal native code can't deal with the execution stack moving to a different place, which is also a big hindrance to interop.
That's what I meant by saying that Go is on its own platform.
It's a totally different model of execution and scheduling.
Just because Go doesn't have a VM like .NET or JVM, doesn't mean it's native.
In fact it could have a VM, Google just haven't gone to the trouble of formalizing and fleshing out one.
Cute girl with pigtails at least!

I have 5.1 so based on what i've read and convenience, I put my surrounds one either side of my couch.
slightly behind 110 degrees from MLP, tilted towards MLP, angled slightly, and tweeter about 2 feet above ear level.
Apparently if you have height speakers then the surrounds should be on either side of you at ear level or along those lines../

The eldest witch pruedence has the power over mind with the ability to bring forth what‚Äôs in her mind into reality.
This manifest a telekinesis.
She is the strongest of the group and has limitless raw power within her that can potentially undo reality itself.

She represents creation and imagination.

I can‚Äôt see, why after the fully stacked news pipeline for April, we shouldn‚Äôt go in big steps straight to our goal of 15$ (remember the  super low mcap?)
yes, all in the same internet.
I also test runing only my pc (the number 3) and is the same, there is no increase or decrease on tfuel/hour.
In 2013, I joined the Reddit running challenge and decided to run barefoot and in Vibrams as far as I possibly could!
I ran two sixes a day and switched to two 8s a day sometime in August.
It was crazy.
Knees were fine tho.

It‚Äôs his relationship with Angel ü§´that kept him their instead of going to Buffy.
She had her shit figured out and don‚Äôt need no man but Angel was a mess and def needed one.
Consdering that almost all LGT style sabers are built with 30awg stranded shitty wire, you would think some 28awg PTFE would be just fine.
While I think it's funny, it's also a PR tactic.
They make a joke out of legimitate critique instead of adressing it, and when they keep releasing Primaris Lieutenants it looks like a continuation of the joke.
The end result is *still* that we're getting more Primaris Lieutenants, but GW have deflected some of the community dissatisfaction.
I'll post the rest of the designs I have done in a bit, there's some I haven't drawn get, but there's biker gang leader chihiro and soldier hifumi and swimmer hiro!

E''kos sell decently well.
Frost protection ones sell the best I think with Naxx.
You have to do a questline in winter spring and then you keep a quest reward item on you (cache of Mauri I think it's called) and they drop off mobs you kill in WS.
Chillwinds drop the ones you want.
You can kill them in a group to farm the area fast as every member in the party that has the cache in their bags can pick one up from the mob.
You will be rewarded üöÄüåï

Modern Mardu Pyro is a grindy midrange deck, nothing like this.
I think it sounds like a fine strategy, but like you said, you'd never be as aggressive and explosive as this deck
I'm kinda liking how they are going outside the norm for most of the enemy combinations for card designs.
Few blros/lorehold cards are focused on combat.
Izzet is not about small spells/storm.
Simic is same ol' shit.
As far as we can see, Golgari is different from what have been done, too.
We still need to see what design window orzhov will go.

I hope its fields.
I think they are both top teir prospects.
But for the style of offense they are bringing in, the quick release and mid range accuracy that Wilson would probably fit better.
After the change 2 med crit and 1 small crit should provide enough along with 2 wamdus spears to reach 100%.
Hopefully this frees up grid slot ls for something that'll help magna more.
My answer when I would get frustrated is the 3x ATM12 VGL-3.
That thing is usually a sandblaster but the TAG helps to take components and kill.
I don't run a light TAG.
I just sacrifice the jumpjets for regular TAG and more ammo.
I try to play it a bit dangerous but also try to make sure I'm near something fairly tanky.
Doesn't always work out but I've had more good runs than bad on that fucker.
Once had a DM let my Orc party member throw my halfling character in combat, I rolled high on all my checks and it was legit one of the most sessions we ever had.
We still bring it up years later.
WFH also makes it possible to move to somewhere with low housing costs.

I have to thank u/emmiedoo for this, she helped me make my mind about the lift kit!
Agreed, but I get where they're coming from.
The whole played-out "one death is a tragedy" thing.
With numbers like this, with stuff this big and messed up, it becomes hard you emotionally connect.
6 billion is way too much to get a grip on, let alone more.
It's nearly impossible to really engage with it.
Because people want to be more than just cool/badass.
Men want to *be* Indiana Jones (young and fit and funny, and get the young damsel NOT 60+ year old Marion Ravenwood, etc.)
and women want to be with him.
That‚Äôs the classic action hero trope.
Like James Bond.
Things like the quarry are kind of what makes minecraft great.
Is it more important to preserve natural beauty or to advance?
Throw some pretty stone pathways around the edge, some lanterns and some fencing/walls.
Maybe some nice stars going around the edge all the way to the bottom.
Alternately, fill it with water, maybe make a channel to the nearest ocean.
I have been trying to contact them but they redirect the call to another country (HOng Kong) and their E-mail facility is suspended for a while.

Just kidding.
Actually your answers are valid as well, and I‚Äôm getting better answers than I‚Äôve thought I would.
You need to understand that your friend never intended or wanted to hurt you.
He has just matured differently than you have.
To you it feels almost like a break-up, and to him it was never as emotional as it was to you, so he really just can't feel that way at all.
To him it was just something that happened that wasn't a big deal.
No friggin way
This show has gotten to the point where the adaptation makes such comedic differences from the novel that when it got to the fivesome, I just sat there laughing cuz of the absurdity of it.
Honestly, they're better off that way.

Never know.
They biggest thing about reclassing to combat arms MOS is whether or not you want to deploy in a combat arms MOS.
You‚Äôre not going to get quality training when you‚Äôre just drilling anyhow (in most cases) apart from maybe your AT‚Äôs or a JRTC or NTC rotation.
I don‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôve trained in my MOS apart from those instances.

This was really, really well done.
The movie was able to provide a happy ending without completely trampling on Violet's character development.
Even if there was a bit of tradeoff to be had there, oh my god did Violet's facial movements and emotions more than make up for it (anytime I saw our girl in the second half of the movie, it would cause tears to well up).
And the "side" plot about Yurith was beautiful.
Leave it to Violet Evergarden to introduce a character and make me cry over them.

For some reason we as a society treat violent deaths as WAY worse than other deaths even if they have the same end result and were both preventable.
Imagine if a mass shooting had killed 146 people yesterday, that would be in the news ALL YEAR.
But about the same amount in California will die today of covid (in the least deadly part of the pandemic in months!)
and it will just be a number in the chart, and apart from the families of the victims nobody will care.
This is not to say that covid is the number one most important thing in the world and nothing else matters, it's to say that the danger to any individual from mass shootings (and violent crime/terrorism in general) is dramatically overstated if all you did was read the news.

Bridge spam isnt the highest skill deck in the world.
But generally on high ladder its a very high skill deck for multiple reasons.
You have to be able to count cycle and elixir super well.
This allows you to know what cards to use to pressure with and when to attack.
Without doing this you wont know how and when to pressure.
75% of MUs will be in favor of your opponent when playing bridge spam.
This is due to the large majority of the meta HCing bridge spam.
Pretty much every MU is played differently so you need to be able to play with different play styles for each specific deck.
Overall when comparing bridge spam to other decks, it has a much higher skill cap.

Oh yes.
Made a lot easier because I prefer shorter stories.
The first comic I read was an old Batman giant with all origin stories.
I read those dozens and dozens of times.
Other early comics were 70s Superman comics out of the dollar box, I also read these like crazy and still have a couple of them.
I still read them probably every couple of years anyway- if I'm not reading them now and then, no need to keep them around IMO...
I‚Äôm also a size 11 for yeezy, are they loose or kind of tight?
I kinda prefer them to be a little loose instead of a little tight
I was terrified of the jellyshroom caves.

She said I was randomly flagged for ID verification.
I have not gotten a letter from them, and she said if I hadn‚Äôt called, I could have been waiting for months to get one.
Because I called, it was brought to my attention, I did the verification online, and now it ‚Äúshould‚Äù finish processing.
I highly advise anyone that is ‚Äústill processing‚Äù like I am, to call them.

We share the workload in different ways.
He works full-time on a rotating schedule usually 10-12 hour shifts.
I work part time (30-hours a week) I do most of the cooking and cleaning because I am home more than he is.
He manages the finances, and I manage the household logistics.
He manages the yard work/ I do the gardening.
These divisions just work for us.
When he is not working, we take care of things equally.
I cook dinner while he sets the table, after dinner he may clean the kitchen while I bathe the kids or vice-versa.
Our kids get 3 stories every night and we alternate that task.
Honestly, the biggest thing is communication.
We share a google calendar and discuss MD appointments, events, needs of children.
If I need him to do something I ask... and he does it.
We are united in a common goal.
Is life easy?
Not always... but We have each other to lean on.

This is good because I was forced to buy online because tweeds and all the others were 2.5-4 times the price than online was.
So instead of buying $40 in store for a month or whatever I would buy $150 online to make the shipping more worth while, and I was good for 6-8 months.
Now that I can pick it up for a modest price I'll do it.
I don't mind even paying $30 in store if online is $20.
I have it that day, no risk of losing it in the mail, and I don't have to buy in bulk if I don't want to.

If I can share other students' main issues with the campus and suggest ideas to improve to our Ombuds/Chancellor office, it can help them be more aware then takes steps in resolving the problems by "planting seeds."

My dad suffers from anxiety in many ways, and hasn't really been able to work for years because of it--it became debilitating to the point where he'd suddenly faint and have amnesia for a few hours (saw it happen, and it scared the crap out of me).
Other times, it would be like he had symptoms of stroke or TIA, but everything would be fine.
One day, I visited my mom's parents (may they rest in peace), and Grandpa went off on how Dad had lost another job working overnight because he just didn't want to work and that he is lazy (he's not--Dad always had been the hardest working guys I've ever known; turns out, working overnights didn't agree with him and it triggered even more severe anxiety).
It's people like my grandfather that make it hard to even discuss meds in many cases, and it's still hard to get rid of that stigma.
What if every night y'all went out, this girl wing-maned you?

With the exception of boros getting an interesting new play style and a couple of mythics, so far the set seems pretty bland (it has a lot of flavor though I‚Äôll give it that).

A milled AK (depending on your income) will for most break the bank.
Your main/only option is an Arsenal Sam7sf.
It has a milled receiver and side folding stock.
It‚Äôs the best milled AK47 you can get right now.
They will run you between $1800-$1900.
This is a buy once cry once purchase.
Those AK‚Äôs will last for a LONG time.
The paint job won‚Äôt, but not much you can do about that besides getting it re-done by a reputable company.

A- It just depends on the power imbalance, and besides, fictional power imbalances aren't exactly as bad as real world ones where someone is actually in danger.
Power imbalance between 14 year old and malicious all-powerful god is definitely bad, and people believe that that story is not only true, but a story of morality.

You will have to likely redo your course.
I had to redo the course but instead of getting a F (fail) grade, I got a DNC - did not complete.

Good luck!
How long has he been on the doxycycline?
Lameness switching from limb to limb is pretty typical of tick disease (especially Lyme).
I'm not sure how quickly you would see improvement in the lameness from the Doxy because tick disease is so stubborn.
Tick disease can also trigger autoimmune problems.

Still waiting for the ss triarc barrel to come back in stock.
I'm predicting a multi-goal game from Garland.
I'd argue that at 2016 Worlds NA also had a big impact on the meta.
NA was the only region really playing Syndra prior to worlds (there were a couple picks in China and one game in EU compared to a 72% presence in NA playoffs), then Worlds rolls around and she's picked/banned in basically every game.
I also specifically remember Monte making fun of TSM for banning Olaf, a pick literally no one else was playing, in all 3 of their games against CLG, then Worlds comes along and he's the #3 in presence overall (this one is a little less convincing because the two S-tier junglers Gragas and Rek'Sai were nerfed in the patches between playoffs and Worlds, but it's unlikely that Olaf would shoot so high up without a buff if there wasn't something there already).

I got my infos about bands and records by several years hanging in HC Punk scene, buying records, reading fanzine, books and talkung to active partecipants.
I have no DLC as the price of game to price of DLC ratio to idiotic.
Game is $20 and goes on sale for much less on PS4 often, and 1 DLC is 75% of base game price.
Now $30 for all DLC past present and future honestly isn't that bad of a deal considering normally it's over $100.
But I only care for like 3 weapons so still not worth it for me.
Luckily you guys on PC sometimes get discounts on DLC and I would assume the season pass at some point.
Here on PS4 never have I ever seen DLC on sale.
If the season pass goes on sale on PS4 for $15 before the heat death of the universe, then sure I'll toss them some money.
They haven't got a buck out of me since I got it free on PS+ forever ago.
I see.
But will you say it's enough to just learn from the ACTEX?

Risk-free means it does not vary regardless of change in returns of risky asset so their covariance and therefore correlation is zero.

Mikan is now only about 2 months old, her sister Baku is still smol while Mikan is already the size of my one year old girls.

I leave them one bowl of pellets and one bowl of mix, fresh veggies and fruits here and there, and all other girls had no problem with the diet I provide.
Mikan is the only one that got fat so quick.
Is there anyway I can do to not let her get fat?

For example, you could work out a deal with a new tenant where after they are approved, sign their lease, and you get confirmation from the landlord that all is good, you cut the new tenant a check for $2k.
It works out in everyone‚Äôs favor.
Landlord gets all the expected rent from the new tenant.
The new tenant gets 2 free month rent (a 33% discount).
And you saved $4k.
Obviously you could offer no discount or a smaller discount to see what interest is out there.
sort of, `std::forward` has a weird implementation with two overloads.

It's not clear from your post which part you think involves gaslighting.
It just sounds like you both have some things to learn (doesn't everyone?

Every single branch is terrible when it comes to this aspect.
The Air Force is better than other branches and if my daughter ever told me she were dead-set on joining the military, I would want it to be the Air Force over any others, BUT the Air Force still has toxic leaders, and has had a few prostitution rings recently busted up, even with senior EO/sexual harassment prevention leadership in the rings.
So it‚Äôs better, but only marginally.
I had to fill out a self-observe scale.
It asked questions related to ADHD like if we feel we get distracted by lights/sound or if we don't finish things.
I then had to take two observation reports for two people in my life.
For me I was no longer in school so I had no one to refer to in school life.
I also haven't worked because I'm chronically ill so I didn't have that.
I had to rely on a family member and friend.
The observation scale had the same questions as the self-observe one, but worded differently.
Pretty much the same though.

I think it could sway some, not all stakers.
But maybe it doesn't have to sway all?
Perhaps all it has to do is sway enough to greatly help out pools with low amounts of stake.
That probably doesn't require the full-ish pools to lose too much of what they have.
Also, it's something that many who are already used to saying, "large/small" would never get on board with, dismissing it as foo foo, shee shee psycho babble.
I simply view it as a misnomer that makes the wrong type of pool attractive.

Also applied to upgrade to the royal indigo and they sent it to me without having to pay the fee!
I know CDC has done some shady stuff in the past but my experience has been good with them so far.

Obviously not financial advice, but my plan is to get a gun, and a boat.
A gun I can carry and conceal easily, chambered in something common (9mm, .40, .45).
A boat between 45‚Äô and 65‚Äô, with a good inventory of sails, a water maker, and some old style nav equipment that I can live aboard and keep underway with a partner and maybe one or two other people that bring a skill to the table, and get to whatever beach in the world least affected by the fallout.
Good luck ü¶ç.

Even if he is an immature twit I think it‚Äôs going a bit far how people are making out he‚Äôs such a bad person, some people are just immature, and have immature humour, and they don‚Äôt think until after they‚Äôve caused distress or something .
But it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt think.
If they did think ‚Äúoh that would actually be quite cruel‚Äù then they might not do it, but some people only realise that after the fact.
I get judging that about him, but it‚Äôs like people think that ‚Äúyeh because he‚Äôs so terrible for not thinking about things like that and because I now have this negative opinion of him he must be some disgusting predator too because he‚Äôs dating a 23 yr old, also I bet he thinks women belong in the kitchen and he probably kills kittens too just cus he must be terrible in every way cus of this thoughtless prank he pulled‚Äù

i think soreness ratings also need to be taken with a pretty hefty grain of salt.
sometimes, you don't get sore because your chosen exercises barely stimulate the target muscle at all, but are super systemically fatiguing, so you have to make sure your SFRs are all in order first.
soreness is also confounded by the recovery time of different muscles & your training frequency.
at 6 weekly sessions, my rear delts are almost always a 1 or 2 on soreness, but if i added 2-3 sets a week i'd be doing 60 rear delt sets a week by week 3 of the meso.

Not fish but in the Covid market that looks like a decent 70+ % which is more than twice over the average purity right now.
It‚Äôs never fully accurate to judge by just a photo but just my thoughts, some rocks look really oily and shiny on the upwards of 80% while others look maybe 65% in this pic, which makes sense I mean a lot of the time certain parts of the brick are more pure.

My own thinking is that there seem to be two broad categories of men who transition: those who are feminine in affect, temperament, interests, behaviours, etc., and those who fixate on some kind of male-typical feminine aesthetic ideal that is predicated on some kind of foundational self-hatred, where dysphoria is understood to mean loathing, hatred, negativity, etc., to the nth degree and only to the nth degree.
A low view of self is assumed.
Yee, I wasn't trying to contradict you, I completely agree with you there.
Big oof, tbh
Trudy would adopt the accent rather quickly, I‚Äôd imagine.

Heritage could be swapped out for Blasphemer which is way easier to get (I just would recommend you get Autoloading so you can wipe blockers and swap without spending ages reloading).
With Leviathan, preferably have the catalyst and stack arrow scavenger and finders (in case you are wondering, *yes* arrow finder works with Heavy Levaithan's Breath ammo despite specifying Primary ammo), and I'd say have shotgun scavenger at least as well.
 - In step 6 of the degassing section you forgot to write that it is important to close the line valve before turning off the pump, otherwise you can pull your pump oil into the degassing chamber.
This can also be done when the desired vacuum of 29inHG is reached, you don't need to let the pump run the whole degassing duration
\- The pie being poisonned makes sense: the poison used gives the illusion of the target dying as they choke on something.
One doesn't choke an wine.
Aren't in your world especially at that time Serbs who took islam called "poturice" aka Bosniaks?
This will be a contentious thing because there are folks who stand firm that none of this stuff is a choice and you are what you are and can‚Äôt change any of it; I think that stance likely comes from a need to self-identify and socially express.
Good points!
I think I'm just over the kids-in-adult-situations thing that exploded after Stranger Things and It.

Now we make capsules to swallow.
As far as smoking or injection I don't have any idea what they dose.
I refuse to shoot up Or smoke it because from what I've heard and researched it's almost a sure way to addiction.
I guess there's an initial rush you get that way that can't be achieved by swallowing.

There may not be that many Jedi anymore, but if Kenobi meets one during his series, I hope it's a Padawan/Knight with some PTSD (Marvel started the trend with including/forcing topics like these in their shows, Star Wars will surely follow suit).

Does anybody have any tips or brand / model suggestions for a keyboard **with well-attached keycaps**?
I have a Corsair K65 and I like it for the most part, *but*, the cross-style keycaps seems to be very prone to popping off, especially when hitting them hard and off-center (e.g., while in a multiplayer game and spamming button presses because you're in a tense situation and it's *exactly the worst possible time* for WADS to pop off ***argh***!)
I've also occasionally had the piece on the keycap break; it's pretty thin and not reinforced well.
Would you say it's no Zaku, boy?
It's not just a strong one, it's a permanent, non-gimmicky strength dragon.
If you missed Fatty your second best choice was either Andromeda if your HP can tank that low on demand or Ramiel/Marshiten.
Granted, Cat, Shinobi, and Arsene are absolutely stupid good skill dragons, the problem is that in Berserk phase you need Strength, not Skills.
Compare that to the other elements that have had some beefy Strength dragons since around or long before their respective Legend Agito fights showed up.
The writing system the Mayans used for Classical Mayan is what's been reconstructed.

I relate.
This is something you can start with.
Working slowly on mindfulness, on _allowing_ and giving *safe* space to it all to come up.
A journal or a good relatable friend really helps.
Becoming more of distracting patterns that likely try to block out something important.
Keep running away from something and it will become scarier than it is.
Progress slow, one thing at a time.
Look up some affirmations to affirm that how you feel is ok or that it's safe to feel that way etc.
Learn some self-care/soothing skills to help you manage bad feelings.
Dealing with negative feelings can make you feel pretty drained afterwards, so take it easy with the inner work.
These things need time.

I moved to the series x from ps4.

Anyway, she got an internship in Norway RIGHT before the pandemic and they moved there temporarily, and part of their reasoning was that they could travel on the weekends and take in Europe.
Then Covid happened.
So they are kind of stuck, can't come back to the US even to visit because they wouldn't be able to go back to Norway (and their cat would be trapped due to quarantine rules) and her internship is basically on paid hold while they are stuck unable to travel.

The strings went missing 10 years ago when I got it in.
I went in and had a scan to make sure it was still there and everything looked fine.
They said I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it until I got it out.
Well it‚Äôs time to get it out and the doc ordered the ultrasound to check the position before he went in.
That‚Äôs when we found it wasn‚Äôt there and he assumed I expelled it unknowingly but ordered an X-ray just in case.
I haven‚Äôt had any symptoms at all which I guess is even more rare!
They originally awarded me at 90% in the beginning (70% schizo and 50% for sleep apnea) and I almost went bankrupt in my appeal process only for them to screw me over at the last minute and give me 100% but none of the 40k they owed me in back pay.
You can also apply to SSDI for a little more, but focus on the 100% for now.
Good luck

My previous car I had (2004 Saturn ion).
I love that car.
But the emergency brake was a little dicey.
It was a manual so to put it in ‚Äòpark‚Äô I used the e brake.
I don‚Äôt usually turn my car off when I‚Äôm delivering groceries.
I could also leave the keys in that car, door wide open, and it be out of sight and know no one would steal it.
So many people don‚Äôt know how to drive manuals anymore.
Lol anyway.
I had to be careful with parking on inclines.
The e brake locked up the back tires.
Well one of them stopped working.
So at the end it locked up one tire.
My first winter doing shipt, I was unloading the groceries and my car literally started sliding down the driveway.
Luckily I was right there and hopped in and stopped it.
But after that whenever I parked even on a slight incline I looked down to see if my car started sliding, what if any damage would it do.

I know it's silly, but I never expected hard mode to be HARD.
Been playing hard mode for years and regularly kicked the game's ass.

Most infiltrators don‚Äôt lose out on tac cloak recharge if you quickly shoot after activating the ability.
Using tac cloak and a power (ie: snap freeze) into a shot in quick succession helps you get the most out of your tac cloak bonuses.

However, Cleveland does play too tall for the guard position and loses the leverage battle for the most part.
He is really high-hipped, that chest flips forward and eyes drop a lot, when initiating first contact, which can create some balance issues and tend to have him slip off blocks.
Because of his build, he is certainly a bit of a waist-bender and his hands get pretty wide in protection, not necessarily landing forceful strikes routinely, while the ability to redirect literally is average at best.
due in part to how much he limits himself at the hip level.
And let‚Äôs not forget, that he only has one full year as starter, because of past academic issues and a broken fibula in 2018.

Still not your junglers ‚Äúfault‚Äù, just their decision to not match the pressure in your lane.

Our family has several different types of income.
We have w-2, self-employed, and investment property income.
The way we have figured it is that we pay tithing on income that we receive before we deduct anything that would be tax deductible, like our mortgage payments or phone bills or things like that.
As you say, we'd be paying those things any way.
If it lowers our tax bill so that we get a tax refund, we don't pay tithing on that money.

It depends on your area and your cashier i suppose.
I live in an area where some municipalities have instituted plastic bans or charging for bags so everybody gets used to keeping reusables on them.
If your cashier is also the type to care about the environment then I can see trying to limit how many bags go out but if you specifically asked for one I think you should have gotten one.
Either that or keep a small reusable on you.

people are gonna find politics in everything.
i could argue that this poll itself is political, because i really do think it sounds like a conservative bias to get called out for sounding like an ignorant dumbass and then suddenly there's a vote to ban political discussion.
i think that's a little knee-jerk, though.
i also think it's a lot of work, since it feels like 90% of reddit posts are relatively partisan when you're talking about subs that are about information, disinformation, and disagreeable behaviors.
if you're theoretically willing to put in the work to 'ban politics,' why not put that effort toward making mod a job that moderates, and enforcing some kinda process to make sure posts toe the line of 'confident' + ' incorrect'?

In response to the idea that admission is a "black box", of course it is.

I know there are non-amphetamine based medicines but don‚Äôt know much about them or their addiction risk.
Definitely sensible to have that conversation should you ever get diagnosed and choose to try meds.
I've only stuck with Yakmia over the years because I found their equipment slightly more reasonable and compatible for my needs.
Nothing wrong with the other brands whatsoever.
Get what you think will work for you, and worse case scenario someone else will buy your used gear.
I don‚Äôt know how it is now with COVID, but sex shops in my area would sometimes have in-person classes/workshops (usually for couples but I‚Äôm sure there is for individuals too) for better sex, tantra and other stuff like that.
So that might be something to look into.

Imo get a cyma cm520 or 522 and a 3 shot Cyma shotgun you'll have more fun and more players available .
Also if you really shop around I'm sure you could get a cheap AEP or gas pistol with no blowback in that price .
Besides Minecraft, poor villagers.
I suggest you google Faerun Map and find a bigger more detailed one.

Why not just implement a regulated salary?
Maybe each school gets a certain number of contracts of different values.
Just spitballing here, but maybe every school gets one 70k contract, three 60ks,10 50ks, ect.
I have to imagine that even the smallest schools are making more than that off the players.
After that you just have to have a no tolerance policy for any money outside that allotment.
Nobody has a competitive edge, and you don't have kids freezing because no one can buy them a jacket.
I get the cube is a cube is a cube thing...But PE is not similar to the other cubes Ive grown and each cube does have its own characteristics.

Yes, haha I do worry about this, however silly it may seem to some.
I haven't been to mine in person yet, but it was only built in the 80s and was a hair salon for a bit.
So I'm hoping if there are ghosts, it'll be sassy, gum-chewing ones who will just make fun of my hair cut.
I'd be okay with that.

upvoted for you
I saw that you mentioned going to Michigan for grad school.
That‚Äôs also a very good option especially if Michigan is better than your safety.
(where you went to Grad school matters more than undergrad ).
Ehh, how priority is it really at this point?

Zinc upper intake is 40mg per day unless under doctors advice.
You can totally OD on it, but I'm really surprised that you haven't noticed some side effects like getting extremely nauseous since you're taking so much, most side effects are noticed when people take more than 30 a day which is why most zinc brands sell it at 20-22 and extra strength at 30mg.
You're on the right path to chat with your doctor, but for sure, check upper limits before taking even over the counter supplements.
But there's more you can do with it if you use the phone after killing one of the targets, you can move the malestrom to the other sides of the map to meet targets.
My favourite kill is the train that you can also use to exit the mission and ON TOP OF THAT you can get Vanya and Rangan to meet outside the slums.

Say what you will, but one thing about not having roundabouts and just using 4-way intersections with lights and sidewalks is that any downtown and a lot of inner suburbs are technically walkable.
Well what's sad is they gave Japan the JM53 (I think its called that?)
And yet that shell is so outdated and they stopped using it a while ago and they have a better shell for their type 90s that actually better or just about the same as other countries main battle tanks main shells
You might like Gig Harbor or the area north toward Ollala (which actually has a bluegrass festival).

Treb could be more inaccurate, so it would be more unlikely to snipe units, it would only reliably hit something when the enemy is marching in formation.
Or lower the splash radius of flaming shots, fire rate is fine IMO, don‚Äôt feel like waiting 20 minutes at sieges to wait for their ammo to run out and begin the assault.
I read the entire Manga, solely because of Anime, specially because episode 19 blew my mind.. it was spectacular.. but is the storyline interesting.. yup...
But is it comparable to one piece.. absolutely no.. it has a very simple storyline and sorry to state, inspite of having good characters, little has been done.. most of the characters justice was done only in the last arc... And Nezuku was so underused that it broke my heart, specially after the brilliant development in the first half.
That's OK I've never heard of covid passing from someone chewing on an ear.

It is the job of logistics managers to sync supply with demand, which has not happened here.
It was always clear that the per capita take rate in vax-suspicious red counties would be well lower than the take rate in more pro-vaccine, more urban blue counties.

Thats a great Idea, what I would love to read are stories from the perspective from something other than the bobs, the world that is beeing created in this universe is almost always shown through the eyes of a bob, I'd like to know how some random humans, deltan, pav etc.

Imagine today a talented goon like McDavid gets cold clocked in the jaw from behind, falls to the ice and 'turtles' against the incoming blows *and then almost all of hockey fandom was like fuck that guy what a turtlin pussy bitch*.
The nineties was a wild time.
One time a star player threatened Bettman *and* his family over a lockout.
Which, like, fair enough but save it for after the TV interview!
You have to go out of your way to be anti-racist, and the white men who go out of their way to be anti-racist are noticeable.
They exist, and many of them are good friends of mine, and you can tell who they are because they don't get super triggered when race comes up as a topic.

The dungeon 1 and dungeon 2 version stories are tied together, so do the first one and then the second one to get the whole story.
Otherwise the rest of the dungeons stay completely independent of each other storywise, so you can just go random.

So if we DID want to camp in VIP, we could theoretically buy a car camping pass and simply-- not-- have a car?
Probably hurts for more people like kidney stones & mayne the other person is being sarcastic but maybe not.

Not familiar with the schools here but don‚Äôt listen to the people in this thread saying ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter where you go to undergrad‚Äù.
Where you go to undergrad is arguably the most important thing for increasing your odds of success in IB recruiting.
The guy saying IBs look for masters and PhDs (lol) is also wrong

They changed the rank system, there is no MP tuning now.
MAX PRO is the best you can get, as on every rank the dominant cars are the MAX PRO, they get a slightly advantage(compare stock to MAX PRO at the same rank, you'll see it).
And well, if you dont upgrade fully, it still doesnt matter.
You can try not upgrading the handling, but that saves only 5 rank points.
Not like its gonna change your opponents.
Could try going for full acceleration upgrade, like 5505 0055.
Everyone is equal in terms of max speed rn, what matters is the car's base stats - acceleration, nitro duration, handling.
What matters is the car you use.
I recommend getting Pininfarina to MAX PRO, as that car is able to destroy everyone else at that rank.
Its funny, basically you want the class kings, because they dominate the rank.
Atom, Donker, Pininfarina, Audi SE, Acura, Ford GT, Beast X, Centenario, Jesko.
Especially the shotguns because they lack a serious oomf to them

I was about to shift completely over to guards, but my economy tanked after my own Russo-Japanese War.
I was on the verge of bankruptcy, but limiting Guards to just 2 per stack helped.
At the moment, I'm on par with the other great powers, except the UK in Army Tech, so mostly Infantry hasn't hurt too much.
Yeah, I found great difficulty with EE on EX because they already "build in" the 2 or 3 months of EE into the "on record until" date.
The date given is generally 6y 10m from DoFD, making EE requests moot most the time since they already or giving you 2 or 3 months with that date listed, meaning you could, at best, request it the month of the "on record until" date (since they generally do not age it off til mid to end of that month) or the month prior.
hello PR ni VP Leni, this is your golden opportunity.

Yeah, don‚Äôt hold on Coinbase (or any exchange for that matter).
You own nothing but an IOU at that point, and if Coinbase decides to lock your account for a random reason (happens all the time), disappear, disable selling/buying, disable withdraws, etc etc etc, you‚Äôre screwed and there‚Äôs not one thing you can do about it because you don‚Äôt control the private key.
They're called "threenagers" for a reason.

What the ü¶Ü
I am not massaging at all.
I wore the compression bandeau to push the implants down for the first month.
Then at my one month post op appt my surgeon said I didn't need to wear it anymore because gravity would settle them over time.
I also got dual plane implants and not completely submuscular, so they never had the REALLY high pec implant look, but they were definitely higher up and making my nipples look weird and low.
Now I'm just being patient, I am worried that a massage could make them drop TOO much and I certainly don't want low hanging boobs!
Did your doctor tell you to massage?

Hector wouldn't allow Roy to be with Lilina.
Yeah, I agree and wasn't implying that her company was stopping her from dancing.
If anything, I've only seen her be self-deprecating about her dance skills, so I was more wondering if anybody had seen any interviews where she talked about wanting to dance, or practicing more so she could dance, etc.
that gave insight on her sudden inclusion of more dancing and choreo in her MV's and promotions.
About 20 minutes later a large number of cop cars arrive and start searching rooms on the upper floors, I shared a room with several other staff and there were a bunch of drugs in there so everyone was scared shitless.
I immediately go to the lobby and hand myself in to prevent a search, the cops only had a few questions before dropping the issue but they told me I was in deep shit with my employer.
